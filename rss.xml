Depending on the situation, self-esteem increases or decreases rapidly. </p><p>In this case, you have to go through a high level of self-esteem several times and help build a stable self-esteem for your child. Of course, just because you see something like the one below doesn't mean your child has a big problem. </p><p>It is an important time when you should observe your child a little more and help the child feel more positive and confident.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Child with low self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@h_w?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">H W</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>Here are most representative characteristics of child with low self-esteem.</p><h3 id="they-are-afraid-of-failure">They are afraid of Failure</h3><p>If they feel like they are going to lose, they stop or give up because they are afraid of failure. Even if they compete, they think giving up is better than losing. They think, <em>"I gave up on purpose."</em> and give up like that creates the thought of  <em>‘It is okay because I am not lost.’</em>.</p><h3 id="they-don-t-challenge-things-likely-to-fail">They don't challenge things likely to fail</h3><p>Children with high self-esteem are not afraid of failure and challenge things whereas children with low self-esteem do not challenge at all because they are afraid of failure. It is because the frustration of failure is so loud and scary. They hope they have only successful memories in their memory.</p><h3 id="the-result-is-more-important-than-the-process">The result is more important than the process</h3><p>When they work, they think that whatever the process is, only the result needs to be good. Because the most important thing for them is successful result rather than hard work and experiences.</p><h3 id="shortcut-is-ok-if-the-result-is-good">Shortcut is ok If the result is good</h3><p>If the result can be good, they think the shortcut in the process is okay. If you take a child solving a problem book for example, you can see it well. Children with high self-esteem focus on the ability to solve problems, regardless of the severity or amount of the problem. If there is a wrong problem, they look closely at it, and they go over the front to see why they are wrong. </p><p>However, children with low self-esteem focus on completing the problem book quickly or on the number of circles. they focus on what they can show others. Therefore, they increase the number of circles by looking at the answers and solving them or by correcting the wrong answer when grading.</p><h3 id="play-more-than-necessary-to-hide-the-frustration">Play more than necessary to hide the frustration</h3><p>They hate letting others know of a failed situation and cannot stand the frustration. They try to pass over their desire to escape with a joke or something else. They want to divert their attention by playing around.</p><h3 id="they-are-seen-putting-off-what-they-have-to-do">They are seen putting off what they have to do</h3><p>When they are afraid that they will fail, they tend to put off work and try to create a situation where they don't have to.</p><h3 id="they-push-others-to-hide-their-inadequacies">They push others to hide their inadequacies</h3><p>They re extremely reluctant to reveal their low self-esteem, failing situation, or inadequacy. It is because it is scary that others will be frustrated again when they learn about themselves. That is why they act to push others or deliberately show exaggeration.</p><h3 id="they-don-t-admit-reality-in-adverse-circumstances">They don't admit reality in adverse circumstances</h3><p>When a situation is unfavorable to them, they often don't admit the reality and talk about other situations.</p><h3 id="make-excuses-in-advance">Make excuses in advance</h3><p>If the result is not good, they make excuses or say less importance for poor result, such as saying, <em>‘I didn’t care about this very much, so I purposely avoided it.’</em></p><h3 id="the-result-is-returned-to-other-people">The result is returned to other people</h3><p>When the outcome of work is not good, the responsibility is returned to the environment or to someone else in order for them to avoid being criticized for their responsibilities.</p><h3 id="other-characteristics">Other characteristics</h3><p>Other characteristics act to appease others, constantly check for love, or care very much about the gaze of others. A child with high self-esteem and well developed self-esteem can make rational and proactive decisions and cope well with negative psychology. However, children with low self-esteem cannot bear to experience failure, so they keep trying to avoid it. But you also have to be careful if your self-esteem is excessive. If you have excessive self-esteem,'I'm good at everything. Because there is a possibility of falling into the supremacy of "I am superior".</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Child with low self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@marisahowenstine?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Marisa Howenstine</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>It is observing what your children are saying and about presenting a very simple frustrating situation such as asking them to listen to something and giving them a toy that is still difficult for children to do and seeing what they will say after a failure. In contrast, children with low self-esteem say things like <em>"So I said I could not or look I thought I chould not."</em></p><p>In the next post, we will find a way to improve or develop self-esteem. </p><p>See you soon!</p>]]></content:encoded>

Rather than an objective and neutral judgment, it has a strong feeling of subjectiveness.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573412930091-cc65eb8f537d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGFuZ2VyfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="People with low self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573412930091-cc65eb8f537d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGFuZ2VyfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573412930091-cc65eb8f537d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGFuZ2VyfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573412930091-cc65eb8f537d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGFuZ2VyfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573412930091-cc65eb8f537d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGFuZ2VyfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@priscilladupreez?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Priscilla Du Preez</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><blockquote>“You are useless.”</blockquote><p>How do you feel when you read this sentence? are you feeling very bad, do you want to refute, or is it just seen as part of the sentence?

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves, not inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have achieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look at'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be disappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional fluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing on the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult because you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.</p><p>Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low.</p><p>This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs.</p><p>But there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for their own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone perfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill yourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="People with low self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jez Timms</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>Let's discuss <a href="/child-with-high-self-esteem/">child with high self-esteem</a> in the next post.‌‌</p>]]></content:encoded>

Efforts to build yourself up is more important than the stability gained by depending on the other person.</p><h3 id="not-afraid-of-mistakes">Not afraid of mistakes</h3><p>Everyone makes mistakes. We learn and grow from mistakes, but people with low self-esteem are busy blaming themselves for mistakes. When we work thinking that no one is perfect, mistakes become a factor that grows us.</p><h3 id="don-t-be-afraid-of-rejection">Don't be afraid of rejection</h3><p>In life, there are cases when you ask someone to ask for it. People with high self-esteem are not hurt even if they are rejected by the other person. If I have the right to make an offer to the other person, the other person has the right to decline the offer. Most people don't refuse because they hate you.</p><h3 id="acknowledge-your-weaknesses">Acknowledge your weaknesses</h3><p>People have many weaknesses. Rather than trying to hide your weaknesses, you need to be confident and accept them. If you admit your weaknesses as they are, weaknesses can turn into strengths. People with low self-esteem see only weaknesses in themselves.</p><h3 id="don-t-care-about-others-eyes">Don't care about others' eyes</h3><p>People with high self-esteem do not confine themselves to public appraisal. You don't care how others see you, you just do your job. He refers to other people's opinions, but only if he is not influenced, he can live his own life. We have the right to choose our own life and live independently.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="People with high self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@wilhelmgunkel?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Wilhelm Gunkel</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><h3 id="don-t-blame">Don't blame</h3><p>If you have low self-esteem, it's easy to attribute the cause to others.

People who love me don't hate others.</p><h3 id="not-very-angry">Not very angry</h3><p>People with strong self-esteem do not get angry. I am not easily hurt by what others say, and I rarely get angry after all. When you're angry, focus on resolving your feelings and ask,'Is this really something that makes you angry?' I worry. A person with weak self-esteem gets angry when he has a strong heart to protect himself.</p><h3 id="like-new-things">Like new things</h3><p>People with high self-esteem make life decisions according to their will.

However, a person with high self-esteem only lives with his or her life at risk.</p><h3 id="don-t-obsess-over-self-esteem">Don't obsess over self-esteem</h3><p>Those who succeed objectively do not necessarily have high self-esteem. Self-esteem can be low or high depending on the situation. The self-esteem built up by force is unsettling. It is better to recognize and love the way you are, rather than trying to increase your self-esteem.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544648583-8db51bc0a57d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxteSUyMHdheXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="People with high self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544648583-8db51bc0a57d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxteSUyMHdheXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544648583-8db51bc0a57d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxteSUyMHdheXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544648583-8db51bc0a57d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxteSUyMHdheXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544648583-8db51bc0a57d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxteSUyMHdheXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@miteneva?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Maria Teneva</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>Let's talk about <a href="/people-with-low-self-esteem/">people with low self-esteem</a> in the next post.</p>]]></content:encoded>

As a result, they have strong pretense to dress up and a fear that people will ignore them unless wear good clothes and carries expensive items.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490367532201-b9bc1dc483f6?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGx1eHVyeXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490367532201-b9bc1dc483f6?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGx1eHVyeXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490367532201-b9bc1dc483f6?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGx1eHVyeXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490367532201-b9bc1dc483f6?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGx1eHVyeXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490367532201-b9bc1dc483f6?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fGx1eHVyeXxlbnwwfHx8&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jonathan_francisca?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jonathan Francisca</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>In order to solve the habit of blaming others and gossiping, you will have to solve the problem of self-esteem and self-love. Whenever you feel attacking yourself, you need to be aware that it is a delusion and let go, and you need to practice to see yourself energetically and positively.</p><p>In addition, the practice of feeling and expressing unconditional love for others such as family is also effective. At the subconscious level, since I and others are not distinguished, love for others is the same as love for me. Practice expressing love and gratitude every day. Regardless of what happens, interpret it positively, give reasons for gratitude, compliment me, and write it down.</p><p>Here is an example encouraging me.</p><blockquote>‌‌I have to wait because I missed the bus. Thanks to it I can spend my spare time thinking about future plan. I thank myself for having a free time for myself. I am lovely who knows how to use and enjoy even a short time.‌‌</blockquote><h3 id="judging-others">Judging others</h3><p>Judging others is also similar to blame and gossip. This is what I say because I think that person's behavior seems strange from my perspective and I think I can't understand. The word '<em><strong>judgment</strong>'</em> in our language has many neutral meanings like '<em><strong>wise judgment</strong>'</em>, so the word <em>'<strong>judgment</strong>'</em> would be close to the word '<em><strong>judging</strong>'</em>.</p><p>Right and wrong are relative, so each person is different. The food you enjoy can cause allergies to others, and what is right for you can be wrong for others. No matter how rational and natural it is to do this from my point of view, it may not be so to others. Unless you are in the position of another person, unless you are a person who has lived the same as that person, you are not entitled to judge and look at whatever way that person lives. No one has the right to judge others. Whatever life it is, it will have to be affirmed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tingeyinjurylawfirm?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Tingey Injury Law Firm</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>Of course, it is very important to keep order and not harm others in a society where many people live. Therefore, if it is a legal matter, they will interfere with each other, but if not, there is no need to intervene. When it comes to things that don't hurt others, you shouldn't say anything like this or that, no matter how the other person lives, and when such thoughts come up, you should look back.</p><p>‌‌Even if it is a problem based on one's own values, I cannot force my perspective on others. It is the person's life, and that person will be responsible for that person's actions. With the attitude of Let it be, you will need to know how to encourage the person how they live.</p><p>‌‌The psychological reason for making judgmental words is that they also have a habit of judging themselves, so it is projected to the outside. When you think for yourself, it's good to think in a way of <em>'Meeting Me'</em>. The way of conveying me is to say the subject of every sentence starting with me. Even when you're thinking alone, using this way makes it easier to reflect on you. Next, if you think about putting <em>'I'</em> in all the objects in the sentence, your psychological problems will be revealed. This is called <em>'subject to change'</em>. Changing the subject reveals my core beliefs, which are often stereotypes. Therefore, try to revise that part. Through this process, we can solve the subconscious complex.</p><h3 id="practice-to-think-outside-the-box">Practice to think outside the box</h3><blockquote>That person is fat.<br>I think that person is fat.<br>I hate that he is fat. (Method of communication)<br>Why did I think that way? (subject to change) <br>I hate that I am fat.<br>Why do I hate being fat?<br>Fat is because it is ugly. (Heavenly believe)<br>Is it true that fat things are ugly? (Thinking from different angles)<br>No. Being fat is relative, and appearance cannot represent a person's worth. <br>It is just an individual characteristic. Both fat people and skinny people are equally precious souls. Other people's appearance has nothing to do with me, and my appearance is just an appearance. <br>Therefore, it is a wrong idea to focus on your appearance and feel like or dislike. I am a precious person as I am.<br>That person is arrogant and likes to show off. (Method of communication)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote><h3 id="lament-as-energy-vampire">Lament as energy vampire</h3><p>When you lament with complaining, you will also  gossip. It is a way in which people with a sense of victim consciousness slander and resent others and assert their innocence. It is a way of showing yourself up by showing that someone else has done something wrong and thinking you are the victim. This is an egoistic way of thinking and to look at the world only from one's point of view and look at the world separately from others.</p><p>If I try to understand the position of others like me, I will not claim only my harm. If you think about the other person's position as a reverse point, the sense of damage will disappear, and even if you have suffered obvious damage, a feeling of compassion will arise.</p><p>Complaints such as gossip takes away the energy of the listener and make them mentally confused. This is called an energy vampire. Blaming third parties while making the person in front of me tired, and at the same time reinforcing one's own ego leads to a triple obsession. Personally, I also struggle with this habit. In order to get out of the habit of complaining,  you have to look back on yourself every moment. <em>'am I trying to complain about it right now? Let's pause. If you say something like this, the person you hear will be painful.' </em>You should be aware of this and try to solve it yourself when you are alone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lephunghia?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Nghia Le</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>The reason why you complain is that you cover up your own problems without looking into them. When I meet the right person, my mouth becomes irritated and I gossip and resent me while talking about myself. I should try to reduce the consciousness of damage inside me and get rid of resentment, hatred, and anger.</p><p>To do that, you have to think from the person's point of view, not just from my standpoint. Claiming that I've been harmed may be unintentional, or it may be that I overdo it. The fundamental reason why you resent others is because you don't have your own inner strength and confidence.</p><p>If I focus on my hope, will, and passion in my life and live faithfully, I have no time to blame others. In other words, because the mental power was not used in the right direction, the surplus power is revealed as a power to blame others. </p><blockquote>'<em>That person made my life like this. That person made me difficult.'</em> Through this thought, I want to protect my incompetence. Even the thought of <em>'I am incompetent'</em> is mistaken.</blockquote><p>If I could just love myself the way I am, all this would melt. If you love me the way you are, do not obsess over the gaze of others, and live dreaming of what you want to do what comes out of you, there is no reason to meddle in and interfere with others' affairs, and there is no reason to blame and resent my work. Those who love myself and live for my dreams will love and respect others as well.</p><h3 id="too-much-explaining-myself">Too much explaining myself</h3><p>Explaining myself is a little different from lament, but similar. Rationalizing and neglecting my faults without acknowledging my faults, it is different from looking at myself positively and encouraging them. The two should not be confused. If you rationalize one's fault after committing an obvious mistake, something that hurts others, human relationships will collapse and your soul will not progress. Words to avoid with excuses, words that try to escape the situation and get out like a loach, irresponsible words, and such words are also not to be said. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Brett Jordan</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><h3 id="bragging-and-bluffing">Bragging and bluffing</h3><p>We should also refrain from bragging words. You can see what level of pride you should avoid. Before you speak, check what kind of mind you are. There is a lack of self-esteem, on the contrary, to boast of oneself as if something is anxious. People don't have to say things that are too obvious. When it comes to finding and showing something to be proud of, there is a desire to receive recognition and attention from others, which means you have not recognized and loved yourself. If you love yourself, you won't brag or brag about it.</p><p>You don't even have to say anything that describes your future plans. You just need to be yourself and show it. When you speak, energy leaks out, and you actually lose the mental power to administer to the process. In fact, you do everything you have to do with words. Such a person speaks as if he would do anything, but he doesn't really do anything and does nothing for others. <em>'If I succeed later, I'll help my parents.'</em> Instead of saying this, you just need to help your parents in reality right away. <em>'Honey, I'll make a lot of money next time and spend a lot of overseas trips.'</em> It is better not to say this, but to wash the dishes at least once in reality. The type of saying <em>'I'll do it well later'</em> is just an attempt to evade responsibility now.</p><p><em>​'I have a business plan like this.' 'I am going to get a job by passing the exam.' </em>There is really no need to explain these words to others. No one is interested in other people's life plans. Do not waste your energy by explaining it to others, but it is something you should try to do with yourself.</p><p>Rationalization and excuses, bluffing and bragging, explaining future plans, all are not true to themselves. Such a person cannot treat himself sincerely and lives by creating countless fake images. Creating and showing self-images by posting all kinds of photos on social media also shows that it is not true. I haven't been able to meet the true-self within me. If we meet the true-self through meditation or self-reflection, we do not have to worry about what we see and defend ourselves to others. Being truthful, not deceived from me, is key to spiritual growth. You will have to know your true-self and make friends with me and live a clear and transparent life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@debrupas?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Pascal Debrunner</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><blockquote>‌‌Meaningful silence is always better than meaningless words. </blockquote><blockquote>‌‌Before making any guesswork, find out the facts.</blockquote>]]>
