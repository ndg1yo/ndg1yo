curious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p><p>Self-esteem is said to be an attitude of respect for me.<br>The definition is well documented in the post I summarized below.<br><a href="http://stylecoach.kr/30130520186">http://stylecoach.kr/30130520186</a></br></br></p><p>You don’t have to have very high self-esteem,<br>If you have low self-esteem, you may be distant from the choices you want.<br>I think a certain degree of self-esteem is essential for a happy life.<br>I've been thinking a lot about this part before<br>Rather than'raising' my self-esteem<br>I think it's'recovering'.</br></br></br></br></br></p><p>The reason is, if the index of self-esteem was zero when we were born<br>Some people's self-esteem drops to-due to some environmental or relational factors.<br>Some people, on the contrary, will have +</br></br></p><p>That's why'raising' self-esteem<br>It's a good story to raise the self-esteem that has fallen to zero.<br>In terms of regaining the zero self-esteem that I had when I was born<br>I wonder if using the word'to recover' is a better fit. ^^</br></br></br></p><p>So just because you have low self-esteem<br>I don't think there is a need to be too discouraged.<br>Even people with + self-esteem can become-at any time depending on the curves of their lives<br>Even those whose self-esteem has fallen to-<br>Because I think I can recover 0 at any time.</br></br></br></br></p><p>I too have self-esteem for myself<br>As a person who thinks he has risen higher in his 30s than in his 20s<br>I think my self-esteem can be lowered at any time,<br>Nevertheless, what I like about me, what I do well, what I like<br>By continuing to discover and grow, we strive to be close to the one I want.<br>In the end, such'effort' has a great effect on restoring self-esteem.<br>So let's take a look at 10 ways to restore self-esteem, organized by Style Coach. ^^</br></br></br></br></br></br></p><ol><li>Start an activity you like</li></ol><p>Start your favorite activity.<br>Some may say that they don't have an activity they like.<br>But before I say'nothing'<br>If I go back to my past, everyone lives<br>What I did while having fun, the activity that I felt joyful about doing this<br>I think I have one.</br></br></br></br></br></p><p>In my case, I can sing, read a book, play the guitar, talk to me, watch a movie, etc.<br>If possible, rather than end with'watching a movie'<br>How to make it mine after watching a movie<br>By keeping a short diary about watching a movie or'review'<br>It's a good idea to create a story.</br></br></br></br></p><p>It is because such stories gather to create my emotions, my personality, and my story. ^^</p><ol><li>Write down what you like about yourself</li></ol><p>Write 10 things you like about the things that make up you.<br>It can be your appearance, your personality, your ability.<br>It doesn't matter if it's very trivial.<br>'The fingers are long and thin'<br>'I feel good about laughing', etc.</br></br></br></br></p><p>If you think you don’t have anything you like because of your low self-esteem<br>Ask a friend or family member who cares about you.<br>Then write it down instead of'denying' it.<br>If you look at it every day and try to acknowledge your strengths,<br>At some point you'll start to see things that you like.</br></br></br></br></p><ol><li>Keep away or ignore self-esteem vampires</li></ol><p>Self-esteem vampires are people who lower my self-esteem and hurt self-esteem.</p><p>Ordinary people easily say things that hurt<br>They say,'It's all telling you to do well.'<br>No matter how much you think of me, my energy<br>If I can’t accept that, so if it acts as a negative energy for me<br>It can never be a good story.</br></br></br></br></p><p>If even the best gift in the world doesn’t suit the recipient,<br>It's not a great gift, it's just useless.</br></p><p>In the name of family, in the name of friends<br>The people who hurt me are tied to the'relationship' of family or friends<br>If left unattended, you can make yourself more atrophied.</br></br></p><p>I think the story they are telling<br>If it negatively affects me, it's good to take a short distance.<br>It is like minimizing the time to bump into, or having fewer meetings.</br></br></p><p>People who thought they were family,<br>To stay away from close friends who thought there was only one<br>It won't be easy.</br></br></p><p>But if they really are for me<br>I will try to hear my story, why I want to distance them from them.<br>If not, you don't have to be disappointed.</br></br></p><p>When it comes to affecting self-esteem,'relationships' really play a big part.<br>It's because people hurt the most.<br>Here's how to make yourself stronger.</br></br></p><ol><li>Making a person who sees my strengths</li></ol><p>The wounds received as a self-esteem vampire are due to relationships with good people<br>It can be healed. But people with low self-esteem<br>Determining whether this person is really for me because of a wound or a lack<br>It can be difficult.</br></br></br></p><p>So you have to be more careful, but nevertheless<br>If you look around well, you will see my strengths that will hold my hand<br>There are many people who have a positive influence.</br></br></p><p>Yesterday, an impressive article appeared.<br>It was an article titled'Because I'm so hard, but will you hug me only once?'<br>A girl in her school uniform said to the person sitting next to her,<br>Most people hug and comfort students<br>They bought me a drink or something to eat.<br>Watch what you do well<br>If you are looking for someone who motivates you to grow and develop in a good direction<br>I think it will be a good influence on me and my life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><ol><li>Praise yourself in the mirror once a day</li></ol><p>Do you like to look in the mirror?<br>I don't like it, but I don't like it.</br></p><p>Mirrors are a great tool to positively consciousize your image.<br>Of course, you can also become conscious negatively.</br></p><p>What do you see first in the mirror?<br>The person who sees the complex first, the person who sees the most fleshy part first<br>Please change your gaze and praise your external part.</br></br></p><p>It doesn't look shiny, but it's thick, so it's nice.<br>It’s the right size, so it’s very trivial to wear shoes.<br>It can be an important compliment.</br></br></p><p>Of course, it is also important to recognize the complex as it is.<br>If you have a lot of belly fat, consider it only as a fact that you have'too much belly fat'.<br>After that, don't come to a conclusion like'I'm ugly, I'm fat'. Hahaha</br></br></p><p>Because the brain creates my image by stacking up what I think<br>At some point, even though I wasn't really ugly and fat<br>The moment will come when you recognize yourself that way.</br></br></p><p>Remember, the habit of being positively conscious of yourself increases your self-esteem.</p><ul><li>Leads to 10 ways to restore self-esteem (bottom). ^^ *<br><a href="https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/39">https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/39</a><br>10 ways to restore self-esteem (bottom)<br>10 ways to restore self-esteem, organized by Style Coach (bottom)</br></br></br></li><li>This is a continuation of the 10 ways to restore self-esteem (top). ^^ *<br><a href="https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/38">https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/38</a></br></li><li>Getting in the habit of accepting praise</li></ul><p>It’s the sixth time now. This takes a lot of effort.<br>Did you do it with 7 things? ㅎㅎㅎ;;</br></p><p>I've been taught that it is humility to refuse praise.<br>But even rejection is modest.<br>I see that most of the people in our country<br>I couldn't take it well and I couldn't even say'praise' well.</br></br></br></p><p>A society that is stingy with'praise'<br>Sometimes I think I'm proud.<br>But it seems that sometimes it takes skill to accept praise.<br>It really depends on what kind of situation, what kind of target, what kind of context it is.</br></br></br></p><p>Nevertheless, the praise that comes to me<br>'Thank you.' Or, naturally, passing it over as a compliment<br>Habits support self-affirmation.</br></br></p><p>No matter how much you praise, people who cannot accept themselves<br>Expectations of yourself are so great that accepting them<br>It may be unacceptable.<br>'I'm still far away.' The thought of'I'm too shy to be praised like this'<br>It could be because you listened too hard.<br>But when the other person sees it, I want to praise him<br>Rather than refusing that part with my will<br>Wouldn't it be better to accept lightly with'thank you' for positive development? ^^</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><ol><li>Learn confident styling/makeup/hair</li></ol><p>This also has to do with what I do.<br>Balance is important in everything.</br></p><p>Decorating your appearance doesn't mean you've been neglected inside.<br>It is important for my self-esteem to take care of the outside with the inside.</br></p><p>Finding the style that suits you, finding makeup,<br>Hair that will make me confident<br>When you look in the mirror, it has the effect that you like yourself more.</br></br></p><p>By finding the image I was hoping for<br>Confidence increases with self-esteem.</br></p><p>However, the important thing is that it must be an external self-esteem accompanied by inner strength.<br>After removing colorful makeup, I feel shabby<br>Anyone who can’t go outside<br>It is enough to take care of your appearance, but lack the attitude of self-recognition.</br></br></br></p><p>Styling, makeup, and hair<br>These are the tools you can use to become the better me, the one you want,<br>It shouldn't be a tool to cover me.<br>By acknowledging myself and putting on the appropriate wrapping paper<br>Don't forget that I can shine more. ^^</br></br></br></br></p><ol><li>Learn to comfort yourself by patting yourself</li></ol><p>Find a friend when you need comfort<br>Consultation</br></p><p>For child<br>Specific practices for raising children with high self-esteem<br>Things to remember when your child gets angry<br>"Please recognize the child as it is, as it is!"</br></br></br></p><p>It is one of the good words that you should have heard or read at least once in parental education or child education.<br>When I heard or read it, I nodded when I heard or read it, but there are many people who say how to apply this in a relationship with a child doesn't really touch. That is why many parents say that it is difficult to practice because they don't know how to do it specifically.</br></p><p>What on earth does "respecting children as they are" mean and how can they be applied in a relationship with them?</p><p>The method is simple.<br>You just have to acknowledge your child's feelings.</br></p><p>Recognizing emotions is the first step in a concrete practice method of'acknowledging the existence of a child as it is.'<br>It is easy for parents to stand in their position now and see and judge their child's emotions.<br>It takes practice and effort to consciously look at the child's emotions from the child's point of view in order to recognize'Oh, you are now~ 00'.</br></br></p><p>Dad put honey in warm water to feed the child. He handed the cup of honey to the child because he wanted it to be cool enough to eat. The child opened his mouth a little and yelled that it was hot, and Dad once again took honey water. After drinking it, he said, "What's hot? It's all cold! Now, nothing really is hot~", and he gave the cup of honey again to the child. He looked at it again carefully and screamed that it was still hot. I wanted to eat it, but I was so hot that I couldn't eat and waited. I was angry and annoyed.</p><p>Everyone wants to be recognized.<br>The small size of a child does not mean that the amount of emotion the child feels is also small.</br></p><p>&#x3C;Do this!> First, you just have to admit it. "Oh, it's hot? Dad looked like it was cool, but it's still hot for you" "Dad will cool it down quickly~ Hoho, hoohoo~" If you cry while crying?"It takes time to cool down, and crying doesn't cool down quickly~" The child doesn't stop with this healing. It only shows a more grumpy reaction. Even in such a case, let's admit it. "I want to try it quickly, but it's hot so it's hot right away. Isn't it hard to wait until you can't eat and cool more?"</p><p>There is another advantage to acknowledging your child's feelings like this.<br>That is, parents consume less energy.<br>Don't run out of energy by saying,'Is you right, am I right?'<br>This makes it easier for the child to calm down, and the parent can move on to the next step.<br>(next step: telling you how to respond-act appropriately-when you feel an emotion)</br></br></br></br></p><p>What parents want to say must be done after acknowledging the child’s heart first.<br>It is well communicated to the child and is heard by the child.<br>Open your child's ears so they can hear you, and then tell them what you want to say.<br>"It takes time to cool down~, what should we wait while our honey water cools down?"<br>The warm finish that the honey water was cool enough and ate deliciously while this conversation came and went!~^^</br></br></br></br></p><p>Recognizing the child's emotions as they are is the first step in a concrete practice method that acknowledges the child's existence as it is. Recognizing and responding to your child's emotions allows them to perceive their emotions and learn how to respond appropriately when feelings are felt.</p><p>Everyone wants to be recognized, and a child's small size doesn't mean that the child's emotions are small.</p><p>First, admit to the pain when a child cries because he or she is sick. How do we react when a child falls or bumps and cries because he is sick? Often, we try to soothe and calm our child by saying that it is okay. Esau isn't that big of a ``big thing,'' but it may seem that the child is screaming unusually. If the child doesn't know his or her heart, he expresses it more strongly to help the other person know. Don't you know? It doesn't seem like this much. If she wants her mom to know how sick I am, she'll have to cry louder!!!' This kind of psychology works. So please admit it first. Please check the pain that the child complains of by patting the back of the crying child, saying, "It hurts a lot?", "I see you crying like this, and it looks like it is a lot of pain". Likewise, the child is sad. Second, when you say that your child is scared, please admit that it is scary. Don't ignore or reduce your child's feelings by saying, "Well, what's that scary? I'm not scared at all". I feel scared, but my parents say it's not. If ignored, the child is confused: perceive what they are feeling and give them guidelines on how to behave appropriately. If you acknowledge and respond, you can move on to the next setp. "It's scary to do 00, then let's hold hands with mom?" (Otherwise,'What's scary' →'I'm scared~'' → Oh my~ I'm not scared at all, Let's go~'→'I hate it, ah ah ah' repeats...) And if you don't understand the feelings your child is feeling, ask what kind of thoughts you're feeling. Judging by my standards is NO! When a child was young, when he entered the beach, he didn't say "It's scary". "Hmm? Are you scared of stepping on the sand?" (Mom) “Yes, I’m scared” (Child) “Joon-ah, what kind of thoughts are you scared?” (Mom) “Sand goes into my feet~” (Child) “Joon-ah, it’s not scary that sand gets into my feet, it’s uncomfortable Jun-i is worried that there will be sand on her feet. You can brush it off or wash it off~ :)" (Mom) Let's correct the expressions the child is saying and tell him how to solve the concerns. I ran into the sandy beach. ^^ Third, when a child is unfamiliar, please admit that unfamiliarity. Seeing a child who greets well and a child who is praised by others makes me proud from the perspective of parents~^^ As a child with good home education As a result, parents are proud of themselves. Different children have different times to adjust to unfamiliar environments and strangers. Some children need more time. So did my child, because when I met a stranger, I was nervous and frozen. And let me know. "Let's say hello the next time we meet ^^" If you don't force it, you'll see a slow but slowly changing child. Don't start expecting a perfect look from the beginning. Children repeat countless times. Fourth, please cherish what your child cherishes with you through practice and time. If your child treats a small toy doll that looks decent and tries to carry it with you anywhere, the mother sees it. Please admit it even if it looks like it is, because it is an object that may seem insignificant on the outside, but it is a precious thing that has an important meaning to a child. By recognizing and responding to your child's emotions like this, he or she can perceive his or her emotions and learn how to react appropriately when they feel them.</p><p>Writer: <i> Author Park Yoon-mi</i><br><i>You can check out the specific practice method that raises the child's self-esteem, <i> (Hanbit Life, Park Yoonmi).</i></i></br></p><p><i><i>“The child's self-esteem increases with frequent self-encouragement. A child raised by a loving family has high self-esteem.” Instructor Oh Hyun-ju, an expert in parenting and education, explained how to raise a child with high self-esteem at the'Happy Times Happy Talk Concert' held at the COEX conference room in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul on the 18th. . Instructor Oh is currently working as a parent lecturer at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, EBS career advancement counselor, and career portfolio production instructor. On this day, lecturer Oh lectures on the theme of <code class="language-text">How to Raise a Child with High Self-Esteem'', where both mothers and children will increase their self-esteem. Instructor Hyun-joo Oh gave a lecture on the theme of </code>Tips for raising children with high self-esteem''. Reporter Kim Geun-hyun ⓒBaby News According to him, self-esteem is the power that leads me to live like myself. People with high self-esteem are characterized by excellent interpersonal skills and empathy, high concentration, and self-improvement toward goals. People with low self-esteem are sensitive to the evaluation of others and interpret others' feelings in their own way. It is difficult to accept other people's opinions and try new things. Instructor Oh said, “Self-esteem is an essential condition for a happy life. Self-esteem builds up before the age of 8, when they enter elementary school. After entering elementary school, it is the time when the self-esteem that has been formed so far is adjusted.” “There are “self-esteem thieves” who are close friends and family members. In the family, especially mothers say hurtful words. She said, “Because a highly self-respecting mother makes a child with high self-esteem, she has to look at her mother first before seeing the child.” Preliminary moms gathered at the Happy Times Happy Talk Concert are listening to lecturer Oh Hyun-joo's lecture. . Reporter Kim Geun-hyun ⓒBaby News He pointed out that as a way to increase the self-esteem of parents, pay attention to yourself and find your own hobbies and pleasures. She separately observed the success of my child and me, and emphasized the recognition of the importance and value of the parental role, referring to beliefs, questions, and actions as a way to raise a child with self-esteem. Instructor Oh advised, “A child with high self-esteem is born only when you believe in yourself even when the child is in your belly,” and advised, “Ask the child in the belly and act as the child wants.” Source: Baby News (<a href="https://www">https://www</a>. .ibabynews.com)</i></i></p><p/><p/><p/><h2 id="good-quotes-about-self-esteem">Good quotes about self-esteem</h2>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Child with low self-esteem]]></title><description><![CDATA[Child with low self-esteem has specific characteristics and we will find them in this post and take a look at your child what he or she has.]]></description><link>https://nadaegyun.netlify.app/child-with-low-self-esteem</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__602f23e01f5481000165563e</guid><category><![CDATA[POST]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Daegyun Na]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 03:36:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.nadaegyun.com/static/60e31f0799eb801c570b7a281421f3ba/photo-1483193722442-5422d99849bc.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="child-with-low-self-esteem">Child with low self-esteem</h2><img src="https://www.nadaegyun.com/static/60e31f0799eb801c570b7a281421f3ba/photo-1483193722442-5422d99849bc.jpg" alt="Child with low self-esteem"/><p>In general, children with well-developed self-esteem have a stable level of self-esteem, whereas children with low self-esteem often change their level of self-esteem. Depending on the situation, self-esteem increases or decreases rapidly. </p><p>In this case, you have to go through a high level of self-esteem several times and help build a stable self-esteem for your child. Of course, just because you see something like the one below doesn't mean your child has a big problem. </p><p>It is an important time when you should observe your child a little more and help the child feel more positive and confident.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Child with low self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1536883968402-cb7250da4a8d?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI4OXx8Y2hpbGRyZW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@h_w?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">H W</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>Here are most representative characteristics of child with low self-esteem.</p><h3 id="they-are-afraid-of-failure">They are afraid of Failure</h3><p>If they feel like they are going to lose, they stop or give up because they are afraid of failure. Even if they compete, they think giving up is better than losing. They think, <em>"I gave up on purpose."</em> and give up like that creates the thought of  <em>‘It is okay because I am not lost.’</em>.</p><h3 id="they-don-t-challenge-things-likely-to-fail">They don't challenge things likely to fail</h3><p>Children with high self-esteem are not afraid of failure and challenge things whereas children with low self-esteem do not challenge at all because they are afraid of failure. It is because the frustration of failure is so loud and scary. They hope they have only successful memories in their memory.</p><h3 id="the-result-is-more-important-than-the-process">The result is more important than the process</h3><p>When they work, they think that whatever the process is, only the result needs to be good. Because the most important thing for them is successful result rather than hard work and experiences.</p><h3 id="shortcut-is-ok-if-the-result-is-good">Shortcut is ok If the result is good</h3><p>If the result can be good, they think the shortcut in the process is okay. If you take a child solving a problem book for example, you can see it well. Children with high self-esteem focus on the ability to solve problems, regardless of the severity or amount of the problem. If there is a wrong problem, they look closely at it, and they go over the front to see why they are wrong. </p><p>However, children with low self-esteem focus on completing the problem book quickly or on the number of circles. they focus on what they can show others. Therefore, they increase the number of circles by looking at the answers and solving them or by correcting the wrong answer when grading.</p><h3 id="play-more-than-necessary-to-hide-the-frustration">Play more than necessary to hide the frustration</h3><p>They hate letting others know of a failed situation and cannot stand the frustration. They try to pass over their desire to escape with a joke or something else.

A child with high self-esteem and well developed self-esteem can make rational and proactive decisions and cope well with negative psychology. However, children with low self-esteem cannot bear to experience failure, so they keep trying to avoid it. But you also have to be careful if your self-esteem is excessive. If you have excessive self-esteem,'I'm good at everything. Because there is a possibility of falling into the supremacy of "I am superior".</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="Child with low self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1537655780520-1e392ead81f2?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGNoaWxkcmVufGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@marisahowenstine?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Marisa Howenstine</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>It is observing what your children are saying and about presenting a very simple frustrating situation such as asking them to listen to something and giving them a toy that is still difficult for children to do and seeing what they will say after a failure.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves, not inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have achieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look at'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be disappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional fluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing on the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult because you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.</p><p>Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low.</p><p>This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs.</p><p>But there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for their own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone perfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill yourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="People with low self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jez Timms</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>Let's discuss <a href="/child-with-high-self-esteem/">child with high self-esteem</a> in the next post.‌‌</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[People with high self-esteem]]></title><description><![CDATA[When you see happy people regardless of the environment, they have their own characteristics.

As your heart to seek recognition and empathy from the other person is increased, your dependence will eventually increase. Efforts to build yourself up is more important than the stability gained by depending on the other person.</p><h3 id="not-afraid-of-mistakes">Not afraid of mistakes</h3><p>Everyone makes mistakes. We learn and grow from mistakes, but people with low self-esteem are busy blaming themselves for mistakes. When we work thinking that no one is perfect, mistakes become a factor that grows us.</p><h3 id="don-t-be-afraid-of-rejection">Don't be afraid of rejection</h3><p>In life, there are cases when you ask someone to ask for it. People with high self-esteem are not hurt even if they are rejected by the other person. If I have the right to make an offer to the other person, the other person has the right to decline the offer. Most people don't refuse because they hate you.</p><h3 id="acknowledge-your-weaknesses">Acknowledge your weaknesses</h3><p>People have many weaknesses. Rather than trying to hide your weaknesses, you need to be confident and accept them. If you admit your weaknesses as they are, weaknesses can turn into strengths. People with low self-esteem see only weaknesses in themselves.</p><h3 id="don-t-care-about-others-eyes">Don't care about others' eyes</h3><p>People with high self-esteem do not confine themselves to public appraisal. You don't care how others see you, you just do your job. He refers to other people's opinions, but only if he is not influenced, he can live his own life. We have the right to choose our own life and live independently.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="People with high self-esteem" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581186084563-8b0176030c11?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDEyfHxvbmUlMjB3YXl8ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@wilhelmgunkel?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Wilhelm Gunkel</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><h3 id="don-t-blame">Don't blame</h3><p>If you have low self-esteem, it's easy to attribute the cause to others. You are responsible for what you decide. People with high self-esteem are never to blame. They know how to accept the results, take them humbly, and try to do the next job.</p><h3 id="don-t-misrepresent-the-other-person">Don't misrepresent the other person</h3><p>People with low self-esteem are busy trying to misrepresent others if they don't misrepresent themselves. Conversely, a person with high self-esteem appreciates and praises the other person's strengths. Looking at the bad points, it is easy to see only the endless bad parts. People who love me don't hate others.</p><h3 id="not-very-angry">Not very angry</h3><p>People with strong self-esteem do not get angry. I am not easily hurt by what others say, and I rarely get angry after all. When you're angry, focus on resolving your feelings and ask,'Is this really something that makes you angry?' I worry. A person with weak self-esteem gets angry when he has a strong heart to protect himself.</p><h3 id="like-new-things">Like new things</h3><p>People with high self-esteem make life decisions according to their will. He is not afraid of new things and has the courage to pioneer. He doesn't get all the results he wants by buying a new job. However, a person with high self-esteem only lives with his or her life at risk.</p><h3 id="don-t-obsess-over-self-esteem">Don't obsess over self-esteem</h3><p>Those who succeed objectively do not necessarily have high self-esteem. Self-esteem can be low or high depending on the situation. The self-esteem built up by force is unsettling.

Whenever you feel attacking yourself, you need to be aware that it is a delusion and let go, and you need to practice to see yourself energetically and positively.</p><p>In addition, the practice of feeling and expressing unconditional love for others such as family is also effective. At the subconscious level, since I and others are not distinguished, love for others is the same as love for me. Practice expressing love and gratitude every day. Regardless of what happens, interpret it positively, give reasons for gratitude, compliment me, and write it down.</p><p>Here is an example encouraging me.</p><blockquote>‌‌I have to wait because I missed the bus. Thanks to it I can spend my spare time thinking about future plan. I thank myself for having a free time for myself. I am lovely who knows how to use and enjoy even a short time.‌‌</blockquote><h3 id="judging-others">Judging others</h3><p>Judging others is also similar to blame and gossip. This is what I say because I think that person's behavior seems strange from my perspective and I think I can't understand. The word '<em><strong>judgment</strong>'</em> in our language has many neutral meanings like '<em><strong>wise judgment</strong>'</em>, so the word <em>'<strong>judgment</strong>'</em> would be close to the word '<em><strong>judging</strong>'</em>.</p><p>Right and wrong are relative, so each person is different. The food you enjoy can cause allergies to others, and what is right for you can be wrong for others. No matter how rational and natural it is to do this from my point of view, it may not be so to others. Unless you are in the position of another person, unless you are a person who has lived the same as that person, you are not entitled to judge and look at whatever way that person lives. No one has the right to judge others. Whatever life it is, it will have to be affirmed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tingeyinjurylawfirm?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Tingey Injury Law Firm</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>Of course, it is very important to keep order and not harm others in a society where many people live. Therefore, if it is a legal matter, they will interfere with each other, but if not, there is no need to intervene. When it comes to things that don't hurt others, you shouldn't say anything like this or that, no matter how the other person lives, and when such thoughts come up, you should look back.</p><p>‌‌Even if it is a problem based on one's own values, I cannot force my perspective on others. It is the person's life, and that person will be responsible for that person's actions. With the attitude of Let it be, you will need to know how to encourage the person how they live.</p><p>‌‌The psychological reason for making judgmental words is that they also have a habit of judging themselves, so it is projected to the outside. When you think for yourself, it's good to think in a way of <em>'Meeting Me'</em>. The way of conveying me is to say the subject of every sentence starting with me. Even when you're thinking alone, using this way makes it easier to reflect on you. Next, if you think about putting <em>'I'</em> in all the objects in the sentence, your psychological problems will be revealed. This is called <em>'subject to change'</em>. Changing the subject reveals my core beliefs, which are often stereotypes. Therefore, try to revise that part. Through this process, we can solve the subconscious complex.</p><h3 id="practice-to-think-outside-the-box">Practice to think outside the box</h3><blockquote>That person is fat.<br>I think that person is fat.<br>I hate that he is fat. (Method of communication)<br>Why did I think that way? (subject to change) <br>I hate that I am fat.<br>Why do I hate being fat?<br>Fat is because it is ugly. (Heavenly believe)<br>Is it true that fat things are ugly? (Thinking from different angles)<br>No. Being fat is relative, and appearance cannot represent a person's worth. <br>It is just an individual characteristic. Both fat people and skinny people are equally precious souls. Other people's appearance has nothing to do with me, and my appearance is just an appearance. <br>Therefore, it is a wrong idea to focus on your appearance and feel like or dislike. I am a precious person as I am.<br>That person is arrogant and likes to show off. (Method of communication)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote><h3 id="lament-as-energy-vampire">Lament as energy vampire</h3><p>When you lament with complaining, you will also  gossip. It is a way in which people with a sense of victim consciousness slander and resent others and assert their innocence. It is a way of showing yourself up by showing that someone else has done something wrong and thinking you are the victim. This is an egoistic way of thinking and to look at the world only from one's point of view and look at the world separately from others.</p><p>If I try to understand the position of others like me, I will not claim only my harm. If you think about the other person's position as a reverse point, the sense of damage will disappear, and even if you have suffered obvious damage, a feeling of compassion will arise.</p><p>Complaints such as gossip takes away the energy of the listener and make them mentally confused. This is called an energy vampire. Blaming third parties while making the person in front of me tired, and at the same time reinforcing one's own ego leads to a triple obsession. Personally, I also struggle with this habit. In order to get out of the habit of complaining,  you have to look back on yourself every moment. <em>'am I trying to complain about it right now? Let's pause. If you say something like this, the person you hear will be painful.' </em>You should be aware of this and try to solve it yourself when you are alone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lephunghia?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Nghia Le</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><p>The reason why you complain is that you cover up your own problems without looking into them. When I meet the right person, my mouth becomes irritated and I gossip and resent me while talking about myself. I should try to reduce the consciousness of damage inside me and get rid of resentment, hatred, and anger.</p><p>To do that, you have to think from the person's point of view, not just from my standpoint. Claiming that I've been harmed may be unintentional, or it may be that I overdo it. The fundamental reason why you resent others is because you don't have your own inner strength and confidence.</p><p>If I focus on my hope, will, and passion in my life and live faithfully, I have no time to blame others. In other words, because the mental power was not used in the right direction, the surplus power is revealed as a power to blame others. </p><blockquote>'<em>That person made my life like this. That person made me difficult.'</em> Through this thought, I want to protect my incompetence. Even the thought of <em>'I am incompetent'</em> is mistaken.</blockquote><p>If I could just love myself the way I am, all this would melt. If you love me the way you are, do not obsess over the gaze of others, and live dreaming of what you want to do what comes out of you, there is no reason to meddle in and interfere with others' affairs, and there is no reason to blame and resent my work. Those who love myself and live for my dreams will love and respect others as well.</p><h3 id="too-much-explaining-myself">Too much explaining myself</h3><p>Explaining myself is a little different from lament, but similar. Rationalizing and neglecting my faults without acknowledging my faults, it is different from looking at myself positively and encouraging them. The two should not be confused. If you rationalize one's fault after committing an obvious mistake, something that hurts others, human relationships will collapse and your soul will not progress. Words to avoid with excuses, words that try to escape the situation and get out like a loach, irresponsible words, and such words are also not to be said. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Brett Jordan</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><h3 id="bragging-and-bluffing">Bragging and bluffing</h3><p>We should also refrain from bragging words. You can see what level of pride you should avoid. Before you speak, check what kind of mind you are. There is a lack of self-esteem, on the contrary, to boast of oneself as if something is anxious. People don't have to say things that are too obvious. When it comes to finding and showing something to be proud of, there is a desire to receive recognition and attention from others, which means you have not recognized and loved yourself. If you love yourself, you won't brag or brag about it.</p><p>You don't even have to say anything that describes your future plans. You just need to be yourself and show it. When you speak, energy leaks out, and you actually lose the mental power to administer to the process. In fact, you do everything you have to do with words. Such a person speaks as if he would do anything, but he doesn't really do anything and does nothing for others. <em>'If I succeed later, I'll help my parents.'</em> Instead of saying this, you just need to help your parents in reality right away. <em>'Honey, I'll make a lot of money next time and spend a lot of overseas trips.'</em> It is better not to say this, but to wash the dishes at least once in reality. The type of saying <em>'I'll do it well later'</em> is just an attempt to evade responsibility now.</p><p><em>​'I have a business plan like this.' 'I am going to get a job by passing the exam.' </em>There is really no need to explain these words to others. No one is interested in other people's life plans. Do not waste your energy by explaining it to others, but it is something you should try to do with yourself.</p><p>Rationalization and excuses, bluffing and bragging, explaining future plans, all are not true to themselves. Such a person cannot treat himself sincerely and lives by creating countless fake images. Creating and showing self-images by posting all kinds of photos on social media also shows that it is not true. I haven't been able to meet the true-self within me. If we meet the true-self through meditation or self-reflection, we do not have to worry about what we see and defend ourselves to others. Being truthful, not deceived from me, is key to spiritual growth. You will have to know your true-self and make friends with me and live a clear and transparent life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000" class="kg-image" alt="How to control being talkative" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@debrupas?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Pascal Debrunner</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></img></figure><blockquote>‌‌Meaningful silence is always better than meaningless words. </blockquote><blockquote>‌‌Before making any guesswork, find out the facts.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item></channel>
