I think people looking for a hint or solution on same topic would have a similar\nmind or characteristic and hope this post can help you currently reading this\npost control being talkative because I also read this post in order for myself\nto improve how to control being talkative and to search my heart.\nThink about what you want to say\nBefore you speak, you need to be aware of what you intend to do. The same goes\nfor doing things, not words. Whatever you say or do, you have an intention to do\nit. Rather than being dragged by my unconscious feelings and thoughts, I asked\nmyself, \"Why do I want to say that?\" And look.\n\nWe as humans have metacognition which is a function of the frontal lobe in the\nbrain and developed by practice and meditation only in humans. In other words,\nwe can only recognize and worry about ourselves.\n\nWhen negative words are gushed out of negative emotions and thoughts, we gush\nout with a strong desire to speak with a flood of negative words. It is not\ntalking but it is about letting negative emotions and thoughts. On the other\nhand, when you say positive words, you are not in a hurry.\n\nPhoto by Volodymyr Hryshchenko\n[https://unsplash.com/@lunarts?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\n‌‌If you are in negative, You have to check why and fix it. Since humans have an\nanimal body, their aggression increases when their basic needs are not met. For\nexample, you will lose your rational apprearance like an hungry animal if you\nare hungry.\n\nWords to avoid\nBlaming and Gossiping\nBlaming and gossiping are one's inner problem projected outward. The way people\ntreat themselves is consistent with all aspects of human relationships with\nothers. People who have a mind to blame themselves are good at blaming others.\nThat is they blame others because they have the lack of their self-esteem and\ndon't know how to love themselves. Even they have a sense of damage that others\nblame and ignore them. As a result, they have strong pretense to dress up and a\nfear that people will ignore them unless wear good clothes and carries expensive\nitems.\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Francisca\n[https://unsplash.com/@jonathan_francisca?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nIn order to solve the habit of blaming others and gossiping, you will have to\nsolve the problem of self-esteem and self-love. Whenever you feel attacking\nyourself, you need to be aware that it is a delusion and let go, and you need to\npractice to see yourself energetically and positively.\n\nIn addition, the practice of feeling and expressing unconditional love for\nothers such as family is also effective. At the subconscious level, since I and\nothers are not distinguished, love for others is the same as love for me.\nPractice expressing love and gratitude every day. Regardless of what happens,\ninterpret it positively, give reasons for gratitude, compliment me, and write it\ndown.\n\nHere is an example encouraging me.\n\n> ‌‌I have to wait because I missed the bus. Thanks to it I can spend my spare\ntime thinking about future plan. I thank myself for having a free time for\nmyself. I am lovely who knows how to use and enjoy even a short time.‌‌\nJudging others\nJudging others is also similar to blame and gossip. This is what I say because I\nthink that person's behavior seems strange from my perspective and I think I\ncan't understand. The word 'judgment' in our language has many neutral meanings\nlike 'wise judgment', so the word 'judgment' would be close to the word 'judging\n'.\n\nRight and wrong are relative, so each person is different. The food you enjoy\ncan cause allergies to others, and what is right for you can be wrong for\nothers. No matter how rational and natural it is to do this from my point of\nview, it may not be so to others. Unless you are in the position of another\nperson, unless you are a person who has lived the same as that person, you are\nnot entitled to judge and look at whatever way that person lives. No one has the\nright to judge others. Whatever life it is, it will have to be affirmed.\n\nPhoto by Tingey Injury Law Firm\n[https://unsplash.com/@tingeyinjurylawfirm?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nOf course, it is very important to keep order and not harm others in a society\nwhere many people live. Therefore, if it is a legal matter, they will interfere\nwith each other, but if not, there is no need to intervene. When it comes to\nthings that don't hurt others, you shouldn't say anything like this or that, no\nmatter how the other person lives, and when such thoughts come up, you should\nlook back.\n\n‌‌Even if it is a problem based on one's own values, I cannot force my\nperspective on others. It is the person's life, and that person will be\nresponsible for that person's actions. With the attitude of Let it be, you will\nneed to know how to encourage the person how they live.\n\n‌‌The psychological reason for making judgmental words is that they also have a\nhabit of judging themselves, so it is projected to the outside. When you think\nfor yourself, it's good to think in a way of 'Meeting Me'. The way of conveying\nme is to say the subject of every sentence starting with me. Even when you're\nthinking alone, using this way makes it easier to reflect on you. Next, if you\nthink about putting 'I' in all the objects in the sentence, your psychological\nproblems will be revealed. This is called 'subject to change'. Changing the\nsubject reveals my core beliefs, which are often stereotypes. Therefore, try to\nrevise that part. Through this process, we can solve the subconscious complex.\n\nPractice to think outside the box\n> That person is fat.\nI think that person is fat.\nI hate that he is fat. (Method of communication)\nWhy did I think that way? (subject to change) \nI hate that I am fat.\nWhy do I hate being fat?\nFat is because it is ugly. (Heavenly believe)\nIs it true that fat things are ugly? (Thinking from different angles)\nNo. Being fat is relative, and appearance cannot represent a person's worth. \nIt is just an individual characteristic. Both fat people and skinny people are\nequally precious souls. Other people's appearance has nothing to do with me, and\nmy appearance is just an appearance. \nTherefore, it is a wrong idea to focus on your appearance and feel like or\ndislike. I am a precious person as I am.\nThat person is arrogant and likes to show off. (Method of communication)\nLament as energy vampire\nWhen you lament with complaining, you will also  gossip. It is a way in which\npeople with a sense of victim consciousness slander and resent others and assert\ntheir innocence. It is a way of showing yourself up by showing that someone else\nhas done something wrong and thinking you are the victim.

When I meet the right person, my mouth becomes irritated and\nI gossip and resent me while talking about myself. I should try to reduce the\nconsciousness of damage inside me and get rid of resentment, hatred, and anger.\n\nTo do that, you have to think from the person's point of view, not just from my\nstandpoint. Claiming that I've been harmed may be unintentional, or it may be\nthat I overdo it. The fundamental reason why you resent others is because you\ndon't have your own inner strength and confidence.\n\nIf I focus on my hope, will, and passion in my life and live faithfully, I have\nno time to blame others. In other words, because the mental power was not used\nin the right direction, the surplus power is revealed as a power to blame\nothers. \n\n> 'That person made my life like this. That person made me difficult.' Through\nthis thought, I want to protect my incompetence. Even the thought of 'I am\nincompetent' is mistaken.\nIf I could just love myself the way I am, all this would melt. If you love me\nthe way you are, do not obsess over the gaze of others, and live dreaming of\nwhat you want to do what comes out of you, there is no reason to meddle in and\ninterfere with others' affairs, and there is no reason to blame and resent my\nwork. Those who love myself and live for my dreams will love and respect others\nas well.\n\nToo much explaining myself\nExplaining myself is a little different from lament, but similar. Rationalizing\nand neglecting my faults without acknowledging my faults, it is different from\nlooking at myself positively and encouraging them. The two should not be\nconfused. If you rationalize one's fault after committing an obvious mistake,\nsomething that hurts others, human relationships will collapse and your soul\nwill not progress. Words to avoid with excuses, words that try to escape the\nsituation and get out like a loach, irresponsible words, and such words are also\nnot to be said. \n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan\n[https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nBragging and bluffing\nWe should also refrain from bragging words. You can see what level of pride you\nshould avoid. Before you speak, check what kind of mind you are. There is a lack\nof self-esteem, on the contrary, to boast of oneself as if something is anxious.\nPeople don't have to say things that are too obvious. When it comes to finding\nand showing something to be proud of, there is a desire to receive recognition\nand attention from others, which means you have not recognized and loved\nyourself. If you love yourself, you won't brag or brag about it.\n\nYou don't even have to say anything that describes your future plans. You just\nneed to be yourself and show it. When you speak, energy leaks out, and you\nactually lose the mental power to administer to the process. In fact, you do\neverything you have to do with words. Such a person speaks as if he would do\nanything, but he doesn't really do anything and does nothing for others. 'If I\nsucceed later, I'll help my parents.' Instead of saying this, you just need to\nhelp your parents in reality right away. 'Honey, I'll make a lot of money next\ntime and spend a lot of overseas trips.' It is better not to say this, but to\nwash the dishes at least once in reality. The type of saying 'I'll do it well\nlater' is just an attempt to evade responsibility now.\n\n​'I have a business plan like this.' 'I am going to get a job by passing the\nexam.' There is really no need to explain these words to others. No one is\ninterested in other people's life plans. Do not waste your energy by explaining\nit to others, but it is something you should try to do with yourself.\n\nRationalization and excuses, bluffing and bragging, explaining future plans, all\nare not true to themselves. Such a person cannot treat himself sincerely and\nlives by creating countless fake images. Creating and showing self-images by\nposting all kinds of photos on social media also shows that it is not true. I\nhaven't been able to meet the true-self within me. If we meet the true-self\nthrough meditation or self-reflection, we do not have to worry about what we see\nand defend ourselves to others. Being truthful, not deceived from me, is key to\nspiritual growth. You will have to know your true-self and make friends with me\nand live a clear and transparent life.\n\nPhoto by Pascal Debrunner\n[https://unsplash.com/@debrupas?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]> \n‌‌Meaningful silence is always better than meaningless words. \n> ‌‌Before making any guesswork, find out the facts.","html":"<blockquote>I think people looking for a hint or solution on same topic would have a similar mind or characteristic and hope this post can help you currently reading this post control being talkative because I also read this post in order for myself to improve how to control being talkative and to search my heart.</blockquote><h2 id=\"think-about-what-you-want-to-say\">Think about what you want to say</h2><p>Before you speak, you need to be aware of what you intend to do.

Whenever you feel attacking yourself, you need to be aware that it is a delusion and let go, and you need to practice to see yourself energetically and positively.</p><p>In addition, the practice of feeling and expressing unconditional love for others such as family is also effective. At the subconscious level, since I and others are not distinguished, love for others is the same as love for me. Practice expressing love and gratitude every day. Regardless of what happens, interpret it positively, give reasons for gratitude, compliment me, and write it down.</p><p>Here is an example encouraging me.</p><blockquote>‌‌I have to wait because I missed the bus.

This is what I say because I think that person's behavior seems strange from my perspective and I think I can't understand.

The food you enjoy can cause allergies to others, and what is right for you can be wrong for others. No matter how rational and natural it is to do this from my point of view, it may not be so to others. Unless you are in the position of another person, unless you are a person who has lived the same as that person, you are not entitled to judge and look at whatever way that person lives.

Even when you're thinking alone, using this way makes it easier to reflect on you. Next, if you think about putting <em>'I'</em> in all the objects in the sentence, your psychological problems will be revealed. This is called <em>'subject to change'</em>. Changing the subject reveals my core beliefs, which are often stereotypes. Therefore, try to revise that part.

When it comes to finding and showing something to be proud of, there is a desire to receive recognition and attention from others, which means you have not recognized and loved yourself. If you love yourself, you won't brag or brag about it.</p><p>You don't even have to say anything that describes your future plans. You just need to be yourself and show it. When you speak, energy leaks out, and you actually lose the mental power to administer to the process. In fact, you do everything you have to do with words. Such a person speaks as if he would do anything, but he doesn't really do anything and does nothing for others. <em>'If I succeed later, I'll help my parents.'</em> Instead of saying this, you just need to help your parents in reality right away. <em>'Honey, I'll make a lot of money next time and spend a lot of overseas trips.'</em> It is better not to say this, but to wash the dishes at least once in reality. The type of saying <em>'I'll do it well later'</em> is just an attempt to evade responsibility now.</p><p><em>​'I have a business plan like this.' 'I am going to get a job by passing the exam.' </em>There is really no need to explain these words to others. No one is interested in other people's life plans. Do not waste your energy by explaining it to others, but it is something you should try to do with yourself.</p><p>Rationalization and excuses, bluffing and bragging, explaining future plans, all are not true to themselves. Such a person cannot treat himself sincerely and lives by creating countless fake images. Creating and showing self-images by posting all kinds of photos on social media also shows that it is not true. I haven't been able to meet the true-self within me. If we meet the true-self through meditation or self-reflection, we do not have to worry about what we see and defend ourselves to others. Being truthful, not deceived from me, is key to spiritual growth. You will have to know your true-self and make friends with me and live a clear and transparent life.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"silent summer evening\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@debrupas?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Pascal Debrunner</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>‌‌Meaningful silence is always better than meaningless words. </blockquote><blockquote>‌‌Before making any guesswork, find out the facts.</blockquote>","url":"https://nadaegyun.digitalpress.blog/how-to-control-being-talkative/","canonical_url":"https://www.nadaegyun.com/how-to-control-being-talkative/","uuid":"95c823cc-d653-4815-978f-ab6c8b9ef453","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":"<div class=\"s9-widget-wrapper\"></div>","codeinjection_styles":"","comment_id":"600e2782edc4f60001e35968","reading_time":9,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<blockquote>I think people looking for a hint or solution on same topic would have a similar mind or characteristic and hope this post can help you currently reading this post control being talkative because I also read this post in order for myself to improve how to control being talkative and to search my heart.</blockquote><h2 id=\"think-about-what-you-want-to-say\">Think about what you want to say</h2><p>Before you speak, you need to be aware of what you intend to do.

The way people treat themselves is consistent with all aspects of human relationships with others. People who have a mind to blame themselves are good at blaming others. That is they blame others because they have the lack of their self-esteem and don't know how to love themselves. Even they have a sense of damage that others blame and ignore them.

Whenever you feel attacking yourself, you need to be aware that it is a delusion and let go, and you need to practice to see yourself energetically and positively.</p><p>In addition, the practice of feeling and expressing unconditional love for others such as family is also effective. At the subconscious level, since I and others are not distinguished, love for others is the same as love for me. Practice expressing love and gratitude every day. Regardless of what happens, interpret it positively, give reasons for gratitude, compliment me, and write it down.</p><p>Here is an example encouraging me.</p><blockquote>‌‌I have to wait because I missed the bus. Thanks to it I can spend my spare time thinking about future plan. I thank myself for having a free time for myself. I am lovely who knows how to use and enjoy even a short time.‌‌</blockquote><h3 id=\"judging-others\">Judging others</h3><p>Judging others is also similar to blame and gossip. This is what I say because I think that person's behavior seems strange from my perspective and I think I can't understand. The word '<em><strong>judgment</strong>'</em> in our language has many neutral meanings like '<em><strong>wise judgment</strong>'</em>, so the word <em>'<strong>judgment</strong>'</em> would be close to the word '<em><strong>judging</strong>'</em>.</p><p>Right and wrong are relative, so each person is different. The food you enjoy can cause allergies to others, and what is right for you can be wrong for others. No matter how rational and natural it is to do this from my point of view, it may not be so to others. Unless you are in the position of another person, unless you are a person who has lived the same as that person, you are not entitled to judge and look at whatever way that person lives. No one has the right to judge others. Whatever life it is, it will have to be affirmed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593115057322-e94b77572f20?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGp1ZGdlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tingeyinjurylawfirm?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Tingey Injury Law Firm</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it is very important to keep order and not harm others in a society where many people live. Therefore, if it is a legal matter, they will interfere with each other, but if not, there is no need to intervene. When it comes to things that don't hurt others, you shouldn't say anything like this or that, no matter how the other person lives, and when such thoughts come up, you should look back.</p><p>‌‌Even if it is a problem based on one's own values, I cannot force my perspective on others. It is the person's life, and that person will be responsible for that person's actions. With the attitude of Let it be, you will need to know how to encourage the person how they live.</p><p>‌‌The psychological reason for making judgmental words is that they also have a habit of judging themselves, so it is projected to the outside. When you think for yourself, it's good to think in a way of <em>'Meeting Me'</em>. The way of conveying me is to say the subject of every sentence starting with me. Even when you're thinking alone, using this way makes it easier to reflect on you. Next, if you think about putting <em>'I'</em> in all the objects in the sentence, your psychological problems will be revealed. This is called <em>'subject to change'</em>. Changing the subject reveals my core beliefs, which are often stereotypes. Therefore, try to revise that part. Through this process, we can solve the subconscious complex.</p><h3 id=\"practice-to-think-outside-the-box\">Practice to think outside the box</h3><blockquote>That person is fat.<br>I think that person is fat.<br>I hate that he is fat. (Method of communication)<br>Why did I think that way? (subject to change) <br>I hate that I am fat.<br>Why do I hate being fat?<br>Fat is because it is ugly. (Heavenly believe)<br>Is it true that fat things are ugly? (Thinking from different angles)<br>No. Being fat is relative, and appearance cannot represent a person's worth. <br>It is just an individual characteristic. Both fat people and skinny people are equally precious souls. Other people's appearance has nothing to do with me, and my appearance is just an appearance. <br>Therefore, it is a wrong idea to focus on your appearance and feel like or dislike. I am a precious person as I am.<br>That person is arrogant and likes to show off. (Method of communication)</blockquote><h3 id=\"lament-as-energy-vampire\">Lament as energy vampire</h3><p>When you lament with complaining, you will also  gossip. It is a way in which people with a sense of victim consciousness slander and resent others and assert their innocence. It is a way of showing yourself up by showing that someone else has done something wrong and thinking you are the victim. This is an egoistic way of thinking and to look at the world only from one's point of view and look at the world separately from others.</p><p>If I try to understand the position of others like me, I will not claim only my harm. If you think about the other person's position as a reverse point, the sense of damage will disappear, and even if you have suffered obvious damage, a feeling of compassion will arise.</p><p>Complaints such as gossip takes away the energy of the listener and make them mentally confused. This is called an energy vampire. Blaming third parties while making the person in front of me tired, and at the same time reinforcing one's own ego leads to a triple obsession. Personally, I also struggle with this habit. In order to get out of the habit of complaining,  you have to look back on yourself every moment. <em>'am I trying to complain about it right now? Let's pause. If you say something like this, the person you hear will be painful.' </em>You should be aware of this and try to solve it yourself when you are alone.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Morning on the top of the mountain\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1452697620382-f6543ead73b5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDkwfHxlbmVyZ3klMjB2YW1waXJlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@lephunghia?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Nghia Le</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>The reason why you complain is that you cover up your own problems without looking into them. When I meet the right person, my mouth becomes irritated and I gossip and resent me while talking about myself. I should try to reduce the consciousness of damage inside me and get rid of resentment, hatred, and anger.</p><p>To do that, you have to think from the person's point of view, not just from my standpoint. Claiming that I've been harmed may be unintentional, or it may be that I overdo it. The fundamental reason why you resent others is because you don't have your own inner strength and confidence.</p><p>If I focus on my hope, will, and passion in my life and live faithfully, I have no time to blame others. In other words, because the mental power was not used in the right direction, the surplus power is revealed as a power to blame others. </p><blockquote>'<em>That person made my life like this. That person made me difficult.'</em> Through this thought, I want to protect my incompetence. Even the thought of <em>'I am incompetent'</em> is mistaken.</blockquote><p>If I could just love myself the way I am, all this would melt. If you love me the way you are, do not obsess over the gaze of others, and live dreaming of what you want to do what comes out of you, there is no reason to meddle in and interfere with others' affairs, and there is no reason to blame and resent my work. Those who love myself and live for my dreams will love and respect others as well.</p><h3 id=\"too-much-explaining-myself\">Too much explaining myself</h3><p>Explaining myself is a little different from lament, but similar. Rationalizing and neglecting my faults without acknowledging my faults, it is different from looking at myself positively and encouraging them. The two should not be confused. If you rationalize one's fault after committing an obvious mistake, something that hurts others, human relationships will collapse and your soul will not progress. Words to avoid with excuses, words that try to escape the situation and get out like a loach, irresponsible words, and such words are also not to be said. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"never complain never explain, complain, explain, scrabble, scrabble pieces, lettering, letters, white background, wood, scrabble tiles, wood, words, wisdom, quote, \n\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596300919209-8aca632f3730?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGV4cGxhaW58ZW58MHx8fA&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Brett Jordan</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"bragging-and-bluffing\">Bragging and bluffing</h3><p>We should also refrain from bragging words. You can see what level of pride you should avoid. Before you speak, check what kind of mind you are. There is a lack of self-esteem, on the contrary, to boast of oneself as if something is anxious. People don't have to say things that are too obvious. When it comes to finding and showing something to be proud of, there is a desire to receive recognition and attention from others, which means you have not recognized and loved yourself. If you love yourself, you won't brag or brag about it.</p><p>You don't even have to say anything that describes your future plans. You just need to be yourself and show it. When you speak, energy leaks out, and you actually lose the mental power to administer to the process. In fact, you do everything you have to do with words. Such a person speaks as if he would do anything, but he doesn't really do anything and does nothing for others. <em>'If I succeed later, I'll help my parents.'</em> Instead of saying this, you just need to help your parents in reality right away. <em>'Honey, I'll make a lot of money next time and spend a lot of overseas trips.'</em> It is better not to say this, but to wash the dishes at least once in reality. The type of saying <em>'I'll do it well later'</em> is just an attempt to evade responsibility now.</p><p><em>​'I have a business plan like this.' 'I am going to get a job by passing the exam.' </em>There is really no need to explain these words to others. No one is interested in other people's life plans. Do not waste your energy by explaining it to others, but it is something you should try to do with yourself.</p><p>Rationalization and excuses, bluffing and bragging, explaining future plans, all are not true to themselves. Such a person cannot treat himself sincerely and lives by creating countless fake images. Creating and showing self-images by posting all kinds of photos on social media also shows that it is not true. I haven't been able to meet the true-self within me. If we meet the true-self through meditation or self-reflection, we do not have to worry about what we see and defend ourselves to others. Being truthful, not deceived from me, is key to spiritual growth. You will have to know your true-self and make friends with me and live a clear and transparent life.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"silent summer evening\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1595405506056-dc235e2b77a5?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDI3fHxzaWxlbmNlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@debrupas?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Pascal Debrunner</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>‌‌Meaningful silence is always better than meaningless words. </blockquote><blockquote>‌‌Before making any guesswork, find out the facts.</blockquote>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I think people looking for a hint or solution on same topic would have a similar mind or characteristic and hope this post can help you currently reading this post control being talkative because I also read this post in order for myself to improve how to control being talkative and to search my heart."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"think-about-what-you-want-to-say"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Think about what you want to say"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Before you speak, you need to be aware of what you intend to do.
