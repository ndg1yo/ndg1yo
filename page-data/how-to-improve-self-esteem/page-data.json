This makes it easier for the child to calm down, and the parent can move on to the next step.<br></p><p>What parents want to say must be done after acknowledging the child’s heart first.

with low self-esteem\nIn general, children with well-developed self-esteem have a stable level of\nself-esteem, whereas children with low self-esteem often change their level of\nself-esteem. Depending on the situation, self-esteem increases or decreases\nrapidly. \n\nIn this case, you have to go through a high level of self-esteem several times\nand help build a stable self-esteem for your child. Of course, just because you\nsee something like the one below doesn't mean your child has a big problem. \n\nIt is an important time when you should observe your child a little more and\nhelp the child feel more positive and confident.\n\nPhoto by H W\n[https://unsplash.com/@h_w?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nHere are most representative characteristics of child with low self-esteem.\n\nThey are afraid of Failure\nIf they feel like they are going to lose, they stop or give up because they are\nafraid of failure. Even if they compete, they think giving up is better than\nlosing. They think, \"I gave up on purpose.\" and give up like that creates the\nthought of‘It is okay because I am not lost.’.\n\nThey don't challenge things likely to fail\nChildren with high self-esteem are not afraid of failure and challenge things\nwhereas children with low self-esteem do not challenge at all because they are\nafraid of failure. It is because the frustration of failure is so loud and\nscary. They hope they have only successful memories in their memory.\n\nThe result is more important than the process\nWhen they work, they think that whatever the process is, only the result needs\nto be good. Because the most important thing for them is successful result\nrather than hard work and experiences.\n\nShortcut is ok If the result is good\nIf the result can be good, they think the shortcut in the process is okay. If\nyou take a child solving a problem book for example, you can see it well.\nChildren with high self-esteem focus on the ability to solve problems,\nregardless of the severity or amount of the problem. If there is a wrong\nproblem, they look closely at it, and they go over the front to see why they are\nwrong. \n\nHowever, children with low self-esteem focus on completing the problem book\nquickly or on the number of circles. they focus on what they can show others.\nTherefore, they increase the number of circles by looking at the answers and\nsolving them or by correcting the wrong answer when grading.\n\nPlay more than necessary to hide the frustration\nThey hate letting others know of a failed situation and cannot stand the\nfrustration. They try to pass over their desire to escape with a joke or\nsomething else. They want to divert their attention by playing around.\n\nThey are seen putting off what they have to do\nWhen they are afraid that they will fail, they tend to put off work and try to\ncreate a situation where they don't have to.\n\nThey push others to hide their inadequacies\nThey re extremely reluctant to reveal their low self-esteem, failing situation,\nor inadequacy. It is because it is scary that others will be frustrated again\nwhen they learn about themselves. That is why they act to push others or\ndeliberately show exaggeration.\n\nThey don't admit reality in adverse circumstances\nWhen a situation is unfavorable to them, they often don't admit the reality and\ntalk about other situations.\n\nMake excuses in advance\nIf the result is not good, they make excuses or say less importance for poor\nresult, such as saying, ‘I didn’t care about this very much, so I purposely\navoided it.’\n\nThe result is returned to other people\nWhen the outcome of work is not good, the responsibility is returned to the\nenvironment or to someone else in order for them to avoid being criticized for\ntheir responsibilities.\n\nOther characteristics\nOther characteristics act to appease others, constantly check for love, or care\nvery much about the gaze of others. A child with high self-esteem and well\ndeveloped self-esteem can make rational and proactive decisions and cope well\nwith negative psychology. However, children with low self-esteem cannot bear to\nexperience failure, so they keep trying to avoid it. But you also have to be\ncareful if your self-esteem is excessive. If you have excessive self-esteem,'I'm\ngood at everything. Because there is a possibility of falling into the supremacy\nof \"I am superior\".\n\nPhoto by Marisa Howenstine\n[https://unsplash.com/@marisahowenstine?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nIt is observing what your children are saying and about presenting a very simple\nfrustrating situation such as asking them to listen to something and giving them\na toy that is still difficult for children to do and seeing what they will say\nafter a failure.
