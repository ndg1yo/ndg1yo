They have the power to be grateful for even the smallest\nthings.\nLet's talk about the characteristics and commonalities of people with high\nself-esteem. Self-esteem affects our lives more than we think and can make us\nmore positive and energetic. as posted earlier, self-esteem is a heart to\nrespect one's dignity, love one's self, and respect one's self. The smaller the\nsize of this mind is, the easier it is to be shaken by the wrods and\ncircumstances of the people around you and hurt yourself without your knowledge. \n\nIf so, let's think about what characteristics of people with high self-esteem\nhave in common.\n\nPhoto by Oziel GÃ³mez\n[https://unsplash.com/@ozgomz?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nPeople with high self-esteem\nDon't depend\nPeople with high self-esteem never depend. As your heart to seek recognition and\nempathy from the other person is increased, your dependence will eventually\nincrease. Efforts to build yourself up is more important than the stability\ngained by depending on the other person.\n\nNot afraid of mistakes\nEveryone makes mistakes. We learn and grow from mistakes, but people with low\nself-esteem are busy blaming themselves for mistakes. When we work thinking that\nno one is perfect, mistakes become a factor that grows us.\n\nDon't be afraid of rejection\nIn life, there are cases when you ask someone to ask for it. People with high\nself-esteem are not hurt even if they are rejected by the other person. If I\nhave the right to make an offer to the other person, the other person has the\nright to decline the offer. Most people don't refuse because they hate you.\n\nAcknowledge your weaknesses\nPeople have many weaknesses. Rather than trying to hide your weaknesses, you\nneed to be confident and accept them. If you admit your weaknesses as they are,\nweaknesses can turn into strengths. People with low self-esteem see only\nweaknesses in themselves.\n\nDon't care about others' eyes\nPeople with high self-esteem do not confine themselves to public appraisal. You\ndon't care how others see you, you just do your job. He refers to other people's\nopinions, but only if he is not influenced, he can live his own life. We have\nthe right to choose our own life and live independently.\n\nPhoto by Wilhelm Gunkel\n[https://unsplash.com/@wilhelmgunkel?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nDon't blame\nIf you have low self-esteem, it's easy to attribute the cause to others. You are\nresponsible for what you decide. People with high self-esteem are never to\nblame. They know how to accept the results, take them humbly, and try to do the\nnext job.\n\nDon't misrepresent the other person\nPeople with low self-esteem are busy trying to misrepresent others if they don't\nmisrepresent themselves. Conversely, a person with high self-esteem appreciates\nand praises the other person's strengths. Looking at the bad points, it is easy\nto see only the endless bad parts. People who love me don't hate others.\n\nNot very angry\nPeople with strong self-esteem do not get angry. I am not easily hurt by what\nothers say, and I rarely get angry after all. When you're angry, focus on\nresolving your feelings and ask,'Is this really something that makes you angry?'\nI worry. A person with weak self-esteem gets angry when he has a strong heart to\nprotect himself.\n\nLike new things\nPeople with high self-esteem make life decisions according to their will. He is\nnot afraid of new things and has the courage to pioneer. He doesn't get all the\nresults he wants by buying a new job. However, a person with high self-esteem\nonly lives with his or her life at risk.\n\nDon't obsess over self-esteem\nThose who succeed objectively do not necessarily have high self-esteem.\nSelf-esteem can be low or high depending on the situation. The self-esteem built\nup by force is unsettling. It is better to recognize and love the way you are,\nrather than trying to increase your self-esteem.\n\nPhoto by Maria Teneva\n[https://unsplash.com/@miteneva?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nLet's talk about people with low self-esteem [/people-with-low-self-esteem/] in\nthe next post.","html":"<blockquote>When you see happy people regardless of the environment, they have their own characteristics.
