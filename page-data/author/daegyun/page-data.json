by Style Coach\nI like to organize things when I get stuck in one\nRedefining style coaching, I searched for self-esteem\nHow to restore or increase self-esteem\nI find that there are quite a few people who are curious.\n\nSelf-esteem is said to be an attitude of respect for me.\nThe definition is well documented in the post I summarized below.\nhttp://stylecoach.kr/30130520186\n\nYou don’t have to have very high self-esteem,\nIf you have low self-esteem, you may be distant from the choices you want.\nI think a certain degree of self-esteem is essential for a happy life.\nI've been thinking a lot about this part before\nRather than'raising' my self-esteem\nI think it's'recovering'.\n\nThe reason is, if the index of self-esteem was zero when we were born\nSome people's self-esteem drops to-due to some environmental or relational\nfactors.\nSome people, on the contrary, will have +\n\nThat's why'raising' self-esteem\nIt's a good story to raise the self-esteem that has fallen to zero.\nIn terms of regaining the zero self-esteem that I had when I was born\nI wonder if using the word'to recover' is a better fit. ^^\n\nSo just because you have low self-esteem\nI don't think there is a need to be too discouraged.\nEven people with + self-esteem can become-at any time depending on the curves of\ntheir lives\nEven those whose self-esteem has fallen to-\nBecause I think I can recover 0 at any time.\n\nI too have self-esteem for myself\nAs a person who thinks he has risen higher in his 30s than in his 20s\nI think my self-esteem can be lowered at any time,\nNevertheless, what I like about me, what I do well, what I like\nBy continuing to discover and grow, we strive to be close to the one I want.\nIn the end, such'effort' has a great effect on restoring self-esteem.\nSo let's take a look at 10 ways to restore self-esteem, organized by Style\nCoach. ^^\n\n 1. Start an activity you like\n\nStart your favorite activity.\nSome may say that they don't have an activity they like.\nBut before I say'nothing'\nIf I go back to my past, everyone lives\nWhat I did while having fun, the activity that I felt joyful about doing this\nI think I have one.\n\nIn my case, I can sing, read a book, play the guitar, talk to me, watch a movie,\netc.\nIf possible, rather than end with'watching a movie'\nHow to make it mine after watching a movie\nBy keeping a short diary about watching a movie or'review'\nIt's a good idea to create a story.\n\nIt is because such stories gather to create my emotions, my personality, and my\nstory. ^^\n\n 1. Write down what you like about yourself\n\nWrite 10 things you like about the things that make up you.\nIt can be your appearance, your personality, your ability.\nIt doesn't matter if it's very trivial.\n'The fingers are long and thin'\n'I feel good about laughing', etc.\n\nIf you think you don’t have anything you like because of your low self-esteem\nAsk a friend or family member who cares about you.\nThen write it down instead of'denying' it.\nIf you look at it every day and try to acknowledge your strengths,\nAt some point you'll start to see things that you like.\n\n 1. Keep away or ignore self-esteem vampires\n\nSelf-esteem vampires are people who lower my self-esteem and hurt self-esteem.\n\nOrdinary people easily say things that hurt\nThey say,'It's all telling you to do well.'\nNo matter how much you think of me, my energy\nIf I can’t accept that, so if it acts as a negative energy for me\nIt can never be a good story.\n\nIf even the best gift in the world doesn’t suit the recipient,\nIt's not a great gift, it's just useless.\n\nIn the name of family, in the name of friends\nThe people who hurt me are tied to the'relationship' of family or friends\nIf left unattended, you can make yourself more atrophied.\n\nI think the story they are telling\nIf it negatively affects me, it's good to take a short distance.\nIt is like minimizing the time to bump into, or having fewer meetings.\n\nPeople who thought they were family,\nTo stay away from close friends who thought there was only one\nIt won't be easy.\n\nBut if they really are for me\nI will try to hear my story, why I want to distance them from them.\nIf not, you don't have to be disappointed.\n\nWhen it comes to affecting self-esteem,'relationships' really play a big part.\nIt's because people hurt the most.\nHere's how to make yourself stronger.\n\n 1. Making a person who sees my strengths\n\nThe wounds received as a self-esteem vampire are due to relationships with good\npeople\nIt can be healed. But people with low self-esteem\nDetermining whether this person is really for me because of a wound or a lack\nIt can be difficult.\n\nSo you have to be more careful, but nevertheless\nIf you look around well, you will see my strengths that will hold my hand\nThere are many people who have a positive influence.\n\nYesterday, an impressive article appeared.\nIt was an article titled'Because I'm so hard, but will you hug me only once?'\nA girl in her school uniform said to the person sitting next to her,\nMost people hug and comfort students\nThey bought me a drink or something to eat.\nWatch what you do well\nIf you are looking for someone who motivates you to grow and develop in a good\ndirection\nI think it will be a good influence on me and my life.\n\n 1. Praise yourself in the mirror once a day\n\nDo you like to look in the mirror?\nI don't like it, but I don't like it.\n\nMirrors are a great tool to positively consciousize your image.\nOf course, you can also become conscious negatively.\n\nWhat do you see first in the mirror?\nThe person who sees the complex first, the person who sees the most fleshy part\nfirst\nPlease change your gaze and praise your external part.\n\nIt doesn't look shiny, but it's thick, so it's nice.\nIt’s the right size, so it’s very trivial to wear shoes.\nIt can be an important compliment.\n\nOf course, it is also important to recognize the complex as it is.\nIf you have a lot of belly fat, consider it only as a fact that you have'too\nmuch belly fat'.\nAfter that, don't come to a conclusion like'I'm ugly, I'm fat'. Hahaha\n\nBecause the brain creates my image by stacking up what I think\nAt some point, even though I wasn't really ugly and fat\nThe moment will come when you recognize yourself that way.\n\nRemember, the habit of being positively conscious of yourself increases your\nself-esteem.\n\n * Leads to 10 ways to restore self-esteem (bottom). ^^ *\n   https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/39\n   10 ways to restore self-esteem (bottom)\n   10 ways to restore self-esteem, organized by Style Coach (bottom)\n * This is a continuation of the 10 ways to restore self-esteem (top). ^^ *\n   https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/38\n * Getting in the habit of accepting praise\n\nIt’s the sixth time now. This takes a lot of effort.\nDid you do it with 7 things? ㅎㅎㅎ;;\n\nI've been taught that it is humility to refuse praise.\nBut even rejection is modest.\nI see that most of the people in our country\nI couldn't take it well and I couldn't even say'praise' well.\n\nA society that is stingy with'praise'\nSometimes I think I'm proud.\nBut it seems that sometimes it takes skill to accept praise.\nIt really depends on what kind of situation, what kind of target, what kind of\ncontext it is.\n\nNevertheless, the praise that comes to me\n'Thank you.' Or, naturally, passing it over as a compliment\nHabits support self-affirmation.\n\nNo matter how much you praise, people who cannot accept themselves\nExpectations of yourself are so great that accepting them\nIt may be unacceptable.\n'I'm still far away.' The thought of'I'm too shy to be praised like this'\nIt could be because you listened too hard.\nBut when the other person sees it, I want to praise him\nRather than refusing that part with my will\nWouldn't it be better to accept lightly with'thank you' for positive\ndevelopment? ^^\n\n 1. Learn confident styling/makeup/hair\n\nThis also has to do with what I do.\nBalance is important in everything.\n\nDecorating your appearance doesn't mean you've been neglected inside.\nIt is important for my self-esteem to take care of the outside with the inside.\n\nFinding the style that suits you, finding makeup,\nHair that will make me confident\nWhen you look in the mirror, it has the effect that you like yourself more.\n\nBy finding the image I was hoping for\nConfidence increases with self-esteem.\n\nHowever, the important thing is that it must be an external self-esteem\naccompanied by inner strength.\nAfter removing colorful makeup, I feel shabby\nAnyone who can’t go outside\nIt is enough to take care of your appearance, but lack the attitude of\nself-recognition.\n\nStyling, makeup, and hair\nThese are the tools you can use to become the better me, the one you want,\nIt shouldn't be a tool to cover me.\nBy acknowledging myself and putting on the appropriate wrapping paper\nDon't forget that I can shine more. ^^\n\n 1. Learn to comfort yourself by patting yourself\n\nFind a friend when you need comfort\nConsultation\n\nFor child\nSpecific practices for raising children with high self-esteem\nThings to remember when your child gets angry\n\"Please recognize the child as it is, as it is!\"\n\nIt is one of the good words that you should have heard or read at least once in\nparental education or child education.\nWhen I heard or read it, I nodded when I heard or read it, but there are many\npeople who say how to apply this in a relationship with a child doesn't really\ntouch. That is why many parents say that it is difficult to practice because\nthey don't know how to do it specifically.\n\nWhat on earth does \"respecting children as they are\" mean and how can they be\napplied in a relationship with them?\n\nThe method is simple.\nYou just have to acknowledge your child's feelings.\n\nRecognizing emotions is the first step in a concrete practice method\nof'acknowledging the existence of a child as it is.'\nIt is easy for parents to stand in their position now and see and judge their\nchild's emotions.\nIt takes practice and effort to consciously look at the child's emotions from\nthe child's point of view in order to recognize'Oh, you are now~ 00'.\n\nDad put honey in warm water to feed the child. He handed the cup of honey to the\nchild because he wanted it to be cool enough to eat. The child opened his mouth\na little and yelled that it was hot, and Dad once again took honey water. After\ndrinking it, he said, \"What's hot? It's all cold! Now, nothing really is hot~\",\nand he gave the cup of honey again to the child. He looked at it again carefully\nand screamed that it was still hot. I wanted to eat it, but I was so hot that I\ncouldn't eat and waited. I was angry and annoyed.\n\nEveryone wants to be recognized.\nThe small size of a child does not mean that the amount of emotion the child\nfeels is also small.\n\n<Do this!> First, you just have to admit it. \"Oh, it's hot? Dad looked like it\nwas cool, but it's still hot for you\" \"Dad will cool it down quickly~ Hoho,\nhoohoo~\" If you cry while crying?\"It takes time to cool down, and crying doesn't\ncool down quickly~\" The child doesn't stop with this healing. It only shows a\nmore grumpy reaction. Even in such a case, let's admit it. \"I want to try it\nquickly, but it's hot so it's hot right away. Isn't it hard to wait until you\ncan't eat and cool more?\"\n\nThere is another advantage to acknowledging your child's feelings like this.\nThat is, parents consume less energy.\nDon't run out of energy by saying,'Is you right, am I right?'\nThis makes it easier for the child to calm down, and the parent can move on to\nthe next step.\n(next step: telling you how to respond-act appropriately-when you feel an\nemotion)\n\nWhat parents want to say must be done after acknowledging the child’s heart\nfirst.\nIt is well communicated to the child and is heard by the child.\nOpen your child's ears so they can hear you, and then tell them what you want to\nsay.\n\"It takes time to cool down~, what should we wait while our honey water cools\ndown?\"\nThe warm finish that the honey water was cool enough and ate deliciously while\nthis conversation came and went!~^^\n\nRecognizing the child's emotions as they are is the first step in a concrete\npractice method that acknowledges the child's existence as it is. Recognizing\nand responding to your child's emotions allows them to perceive their emotions\nand learn how to respond appropriately when feelings are felt.\n\nEveryone wants to be recognized, and a child's small size doesn't mean that the\nchild's emotions are small.\n\nFirst, admit to the pain when a child cries because he or she is sick. How do we\nreact when a child falls or bumps and cries because he is sick? Often, we try to\nsoothe and calm our child by saying that it is okay. Esau isn't that big of a\n``big thing,'' but it may seem that the child is screaming unusually. If the\nchild doesn't know his or her heart, he expresses it more strongly to help the\nother person know. Don't you know? It doesn't seem like this much. If she wants\nher mom to know how sick I am, she'll have to cry louder!!!' This kind of\npsychology works. So please admit it first. Please check the pain that the child\ncomplains of by patting the back of the crying child, saying, \"It hurts a lot?\",\n\"I see you crying like this, and it looks like it is a lot of pain\". Likewise,\nthe child is sad. Second, when you say that your child is scared, please admit\nthat it is scary. Don't ignore or reduce your child's feelings by saying, \"Well,\nwhat's that scary? I'm not scared at all\". I feel scared, but my parents say\nit's not. If ignored, the child is confused: perceive what they are feeling and\ngive them guidelines on how to behave appropriately. If you acknowledge and\nrespond, you can move on to the next setp. \"It's scary to do 00, then let's hold\nhands with mom?\" (Otherwise,'What's scary' →'I'm scared~'' → Oh my~ I'm not\nscared at all, Let's go~'→'I hate it, ah ah ah' repeats...) And if you don't\nunderstand the feelings your child is feeling, ask what kind of thoughts you're\nfeeling. Judging by my standards is NO! When a child was young, when he entered\nthe beach, he didn't say \"It's scary\". \"Hmm? Are you scared of stepping on the\nsand?\" (Mom) “Yes, I’m scared” (Child) “Joon-ah, what kind of thoughts are you\nscared?” (Mom) “Sand goes into my feet~” (Child) “Joon-ah, it’s not scary that\nsand gets into my feet, it’s uncomfortable Jun-i is worried that there will be\nsand on her feet. You can brush it off or wash it off~ :)\" (Mom) Let's correct\nthe expressions the child is saying and tell him how to solve the concerns. I\nran into the sandy beach. ^^ Third, when a child is unfamiliar, please admit\nthat unfamiliarity. Seeing a child who greets well and a child who is praised by\nothers makes me proud from the perspective of parents~^^ As a child with good\nhome education As a result, parents are proud of themselves. Different children\nhave different times to adjust to unfamiliar environments and strangers. Some\nchildren need more time. So did my child, because when I met a stranger, I was\nnervous and frozen. And let me know. \"Let's say hello the next time we meet ^^\"\nIf you don't force it, you'll see a slow but slowly changing child. Don't start\nexpecting a perfect look from the beginning. Children repeat countless times.\nFourth, please cherish what your child cherishes with you through practice and\ntime. If your child treats a small toy doll that looks decent and tries to carry\nit with you anywhere, the mother sees it. Please admit it even if it looks like\nit is, because it is an object that may seem insignificant on the outside, but\nit is a precious thing that has an important meaning to a child. By recognizing\nand responding to your child's emotions like this, he or she can perceive his or\nher emotions and learn how to react appropriately when they feel them.\n\nWriter: Author Park Yoon-mi\nYou can check out the specific practice method that raises the child's\nself-esteem, (Hanbit Life, Park Yoonmi).\n\n“The child's self-esteem increases with frequent self-encouragement. A child\nraised by a loving family has high self-esteem.” Instructor Oh Hyun-ju, an\nexpert in parenting and education, explained how to raise a child with high\nself-esteem at the'Happy Times Happy Talk Concert' held at the COEX conference\nroom in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul on the 18th. . Instructor Oh is\ncurrently working as a parent lecturer at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of\nEducation, EBS career advancement counselor, and career portfolio production\ninstructor. On this day, lecturer Oh lectures on the theme of How to Raise a\nChild with High Self-Esteem'', where both mothers and children will increase\ntheir self-esteem. Instructor Hyun-joo Oh gave a lecture on the theme of Tips\nfor raising children with high self-esteem''.

That is why many parents say that it is difficult to practice because they don't know how to do it specifically.</p><p>What on earth does \"respecting children as they are\" mean and how can they be applied in a relationship with them?</p><p>The method is simple.<br>You just have to acknowledge your child's feelings.</p><p>Recognizing emotions is the first step in a concrete practice method of'acknowledging the existence of a child as it is.'<br>It is easy for parents to stand in their position now and see and judge their child's emotions.<br>It takes practice and effort to consciously look at the child's emotions from the child's point of view in order to recognize'Oh, you are now~ 00'.</p><p>Dad put honey in warm water to feed the child. He handed the cup of honey to the child because he wanted it to be cool enough to eat. The child opened his mouth a little and yelled that it was hot, and Dad once again took honey water. After drinking it, he said, \"What's hot? It's all cold! Now, nothing really is hot~\", and he gave the cup of honey again to the child. He looked at it again carefully and screamed that it was still hot. I wanted to eat it, but I was so hot that I couldn't eat and waited. I was angry and annoyed.</p><p>Everyone wants to be recognized.<br>The small size of a child does not mean that the amount of emotion the child feels is also small.</p><p>&lt;Do this!&gt; First, you just have to admit it. \"Oh, it's hot? Dad looked like it was cool, but it's still hot for you\" \"Dad will cool it down quickly~ Hoho, hoohoo~\" If you cry while crying?\"It takes time to cool down, and crying doesn't cool down quickly~\" The child doesn't stop with this healing. It only shows a more grumpy reaction. Even in such a case, let's admit it. \"I want to try it quickly, but it's hot so it's hot right away. Isn't it hard to wait until you can't eat and cool more?\"</p><p>There is another advantage to acknowledging your child's feelings like this.<br>That is, parents consume less energy.<br>Don't run out of energy by saying,'Is you right, am I right?'<br>This makes it easier for the child to calm down, and the parent can move on to the next step.<br>(next step: telling you how to respond-act appropriately-when you feel an emotion)</p><p>What parents want to say must be done after acknowledging the child’s heart first.<br>It is well communicated to the child and is heard by the child.<br>Open your child's ears so they can hear you, and then tell them what you want to say.<br>\"It takes time to cool down~, what should we wait while our honey water cools down?\"<br>The warm finish that the honey water was cool enough and ate deliciously while this conversation came and went!~^^</p><p>Recognizing the child's emotions as they are is the first step in a concrete practice method that acknowledges the child's existence as it is. Recognizing and responding to your child's emotions allows them to perceive their emotions and learn how to respond appropriately when feelings are felt.</p><p>Everyone wants to be recognized, and a child's small size doesn't mean that the child's emotions are small.</p><p>First, admit to the pain when a child cries because he or she is sick. How do we react when a child falls or bumps and cries because he is sick? Often, we try to soothe and calm our child by saying that it is okay. Esau isn't that big of a ``big thing,'' but it may seem that the child is screaming unusually. If the child doesn't know his or her heart, he expresses it more strongly to help the other person know. Don't you know? It doesn't seem like this much. If she wants her mom to know how sick I am, she'll have to cry louder!!!' This kind of psychology works. So please admit it first. Please check the pain that the child complains of by patting the back of the crying child, saying, \"It hurts a lot?\", \"I see you crying like this, and it looks like it is a lot of pain\". Likewise, the child is sad. Second, when you say that your child is scared, please admit that it is scary. Don't ignore or reduce your child's feelings by saying, \"Well, what's that scary? I'm not scared at all\". I feel scared, but my parents say it's not. If ignored, the child is confused: perceive what they are feeling and give them guidelines on how to behave appropriately. If you acknowledge and respond, you can move on to the next setp. \"It's scary to do 00, then let's hold hands with mom?\" (Otherwise,'What's scary' →'I'm scared~'' → Oh my~ I'm not scared at all, Let's go~'→'I hate it, ah ah ah' repeats...) And if you don't understand the feelings your child is feeling, ask what kind of thoughts you're feeling. Judging by my standards is NO! When a child was young, when he entered the beach, he didn't say \"It's scary\". \"Hmm? Are you scared of stepping on the sand?\" (Mom) “Yes, I’m scared” (Child) “Joon-ah, what kind of thoughts are you scared?” (Mom) “Sand goes into my feet~” (Child) “Joon-ah, it’s not scary that sand gets into my feet, it’s uncomfortable Jun-i is worried that there will be sand on her feet. You can brush it off or wash it off~ :)\" (Mom) Let's correct the expressions the child is saying and tell him how to solve the concerns. I ran into the sandy beach. ^^ Third, when a child is unfamiliar, please admit that unfamiliarity. Seeing a child who greets well and a child who is praised by others makes me proud from the perspective of parents~^^ As a child with good home education As a result, parents are proud of themselves. Different children have different times to adjust to unfamiliar environments and strangers. Some children need more time. So did my child, because when I met a stranger, I was nervous and frozen. And let me know. \"Let's say hello the next time we meet ^^\" If you don't force it, you'll see a slow but slowly changing child. Don't start expecting a perfect look from the beginning. Children repeat countless times. Fourth, please cherish what your child cherishes with you through practice and time. If your child treats a small toy doll that looks decent and tries to carry it with you anywhere, the mother sees it. Please admit it even if it looks like it is, because it is an object that may seem insignificant on the outside, but it is a precious thing that has an important meaning to a child. By recognizing and responding to your child's emotions like this, he or she can perceive his or her emotions and learn how to react appropriately when they feel them.</p><p>Writer: <i> Author Park Yoon-mi</i><br><i>You can check out the specific practice method that raises the child's self-esteem, <i> (Hanbit Life, Park Yoonmi).</i></i></p><p><i><i>“The child's self-esteem increases with frequent self-encouragement.

He handed the cup of honey to the child because he wanted it to be cool enough to eat. The child opened his mouth a little and yelled that it was hot, and Dad once again took honey water. After drinking it, he said, \"What's hot? It's all cold! Now, nothing really is hot~\", and he gave the cup of honey again to the child. He looked at it again carefully and screamed that it was still hot. I wanted to eat it, but I was so hot that I couldn't eat and waited. I was angry and annoyed.</p><p>Everyone wants to be recognized.<br>The small size of a child does not mean that the amount of emotion the child feels is also small.</p><p>&#x3C;Do this!> First, you just have to admit it. \"Oh, it's hot? Dad looked like it was cool, but it's still hot for you\" \"Dad will cool it down quickly~ Hoho, hoohoo~\" If you cry while crying?\"It takes time to cool down, and crying doesn't cool down quickly~\" The child doesn't stop with this healing. It only shows a more grumpy reaction. Even in such a case, let's admit it. \"I want to try it quickly, but it's hot so it's hot right away. Isn't it hard to wait until you can't eat and cool more?\"</p><p>There is another advantage to acknowledging your child's feelings like this.<br>That is, parents consume less energy.<br>Don't run out of energy by saying,'Is you right, am I right?'<br>This makes it easier for the child to calm down, and the parent can move on to the next step.<br>(next step: telling you how to respond-act appropriately-when you feel an emotion)</p><p>What parents want to say must be done after acknowledging the child’s heart first.<br>It is well communicated to the child and is heard by the child.<br>Open your child's ears so they can hear you, and then tell them what you want to say.<br>\"It takes time to cool down~, what should we wait while our honey water cools down?\"<br>The warm finish that the honey water was cool enough and ate deliciously while this conversation came and went!~^^</p><p>Recognizing the child's emotions as they are is the first step in a concrete practice method that acknowledges the child's existence as it is. Recognizing and responding to your child's emotions allows them to perceive their emotions and learn how to respond appropriately when feelings are felt.</p><p>Everyone wants to be recognized, and a child's small size doesn't mean that the child's emotions are small.</p><p>First, admit to the pain when a child cries because he or she is sick. How do we react when a child falls or bumps and cries because he is sick? Often, we try to soothe and calm our child by saying that it is okay. Esau isn't that big of a ``big thing,'' but it may seem that the child is screaming unusually. If the child doesn't know his or her heart, he expresses it more strongly to help the other person know. Don't you know? It doesn't seem like this much. If she wants her mom to know how sick I am, she'll have to cry louder!!!' This kind of psychology works. So please admit it first. Please check the pain that the child complains of by patting the back of the crying child, saying, \"It hurts a lot?\", \"I see you crying like this, and it looks like it is a lot of pain\". Likewise, the child is sad. Second, when you say that your child is scared, please admit that it is scary. Don't ignore or reduce your child's feelings by saying, \"Well, what's that scary? I'm not scared at all\". I feel scared, but my parents say it's not. If ignored, the child is confused: perceive what they are feeling and give them guidelines on how to behave appropriately. If you acknowledge and respond, you can move on to the next setp. \"It's scary to do 00, then let's hold hands with mom?\" (Otherwise,'What's scary' →'I'm scared~'' → Oh my~ I'm not scared at all, Let's go~'→'I hate it, ah ah ah' repeats...) And if you don't understand the feelings your child is feeling, ask what kind of thoughts you're feeling. Judging by my standards is NO! When a child was young, when he entered the beach, he didn't say \"It's scary\". \"Hmm? Are you scared of stepping on the sand?\" (Mom) “Yes, I’m scared” (Child) “Joon-ah, what kind of thoughts are you scared?” (Mom) “Sand goes into my feet~” (Child) “Joon-ah, it’s not scary that sand gets into my feet, it’s uncomfortable Jun-i is worried that there will be sand on her feet. You can brush it off or wash it off~ :)\" (Mom) Let's correct the expressions the child is saying and tell him how to solve the concerns. I ran into the sandy beach. ^^ Third, when a child is unfamiliar, please admit that unfamiliarity. Seeing a child who greets well and a child who is praised by others makes me proud from the perspective of parents~^^ As a child with good home education As a result, parents are proud of themselves. Different children have different times to adjust to unfamiliar environments and strangers. Some children need more time. So did my child, because when I met a stranger, I was nervous and frozen. And let me know. \"Let's say hello the next time we meet ^^\" If you don't force it, you'll see a slow but slowly changing child. Don't start expecting a perfect look from the beginning. Children repeat countless times. Fourth, please cherish what your child cherishes with you through practice and time. If your child treats a small toy doll that looks decent and tries to carry it with you anywhere, the mother sees it. Please admit it even if it looks like it is, because it is an object that may seem insignificant on the outside, but it is a precious thing that has an important meaning to a child. By recognizing and responding to your child's emotions like this, he or she can perceive his or her emotions and learn how to react appropriately when they feel them.</p><p>Writer: <i> Author Park Yoon-mi</i><br><i>You can check out the specific practice method that raises the child's self-esteem, <i> (Hanbit Life, Park Yoonmi).</i></i></p><p><i><i>“The child's self-esteem increases with frequent self-encouragement. A child raised by a loving family has high self-esteem.” Instructor Oh Hyun-ju, an expert in parenting and education, explained how to raise a child with high self-esteem at the'Happy Times Happy Talk Concert' held at the COEX conference room in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul on the 18th. . Instructor Oh is currently working as a parent lecturer at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, EBS career advancement counselor, and career portfolio production instructor. On this day, lecturer Oh lectures on the theme of <code class=\"language-text\">How to Raise a Child with High Self-Esteem'', where both mothers and children will increase their self-esteem. Instructor Hyun-joo Oh gave a lecture on the theme of </code>Tips for raising children with high self-esteem''. Reporter Kim Geun-hyun ⓒBaby News According to him, self-esteem is the power that leads me to live like myself. People with high self-esteem are characterized by excellent interpersonal skills and empathy, high concentration, and self-improvement toward goals. People with low self-esteem are sensitive to the evaluation of others and interpret others' feelings in their own way. It is difficult to accept other people's opinions and try new things. Instructor Oh said, “Self-esteem is an essential condition for a happy life. Self-esteem builds up before the age of 8, when they enter elementary school. After entering elementary school, it is the time when the self-esteem that has been formed so far is adjusted.” “There are “self-esteem thieves” who are close friends and family members. In the family, especially mothers say hurtful words. She said, “Because a highly self-respecting mother makes a child with high self-esteem, she has to look at her mother first before seeing the child.” Preliminary moms gathered at the Happy Times Happy Talk Concert are listening to lecturer Oh Hyun-joo's lecture. . Reporter Kim Geun-hyun ⓒBaby News He pointed out that as a way to increase the self-esteem of parents, pay attention to yourself and find your own hobbies and pleasures. She separately observed the success of my child and me, and emphasized the recognition of the importance and value of the parental role, referring to beliefs, questions, and actions as a way to raise a child with self-esteem. Instructor Oh advised, “A child with high self-esteem is born only when you believe in yourself even when the child is in your belly,” and advised, “Ask the child in the belly and act as the child wants.” Source: Baby News (<a href=\"https://www\">https://www</a>. .ibabynews.com)</i></i></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2 id=\"good-quotes-about-self-esteem\">Good quotes about

How do we react when a child falls or bumps and cries because he is sick? Often, we try to soothe and calm our child by saying that it is okay. Esau isn't that big of a ``big thing,'' but it may seem that the child is screaming unusually. If the child doesn't know his or her heart, he expresses it more strongly to help the other person know. Don't you know? It doesn't seem like this much. If she wants her mom to know how sick I am, she'll have to cry louder!!!' This kind of psychology works. So please admit it first. Please check the pain that the child complains of by patting the back of the crying child, saying, \"It hurts a lot?\", \"I see you crying like this, and it looks like it is a lot of pain\". Likewise, the child is sad. Second, when you say that your child is scared, please admit that it is scary. Don't ignore or reduce your child's feelings by saying, \"Well, what's that scary? I'm not scared at all\". I feel scared, but my parents say it's not. If ignored, the child is confused: perceive what they are feeling and give them guidelines on how to behave appropriately. If you acknowledge and respond, you can move on to the next setp. \"It's scary to do 00, then let's hold hands with mom?\" (Otherwise,'What's scary' →'I'm scared~'' → Oh my~ I'm not scared at all, Let's go~'→'I hate it, ah ah ah' repeats...) And if you don't understand the feelings your child is feeling, ask what kind of thoughts you're feeling. Judging by my standards is NO! When a child was young, when he entered the beach, he didn't say \"It's scary\". \"Hmm? Are you scared of stepping on the sand?\" (Mom) “Yes, I’m scared” (Child) “Joon-ah, what kind of thoughts are you scared?” (Mom) “Sand goes into my feet~” (Child) “Joon-ah, it’s not scary that sand gets into my feet, it’s uncomfortable Jun-i is worried that there will be sand on her feet. You can brush it off or wash it off~ :)\" (Mom) Let's correct the expressions the child is saying and tell him how to solve the concerns. I ran into the sandy beach. ^^ Third, when a child is unfamiliar, please admit that unfamiliarity. Seeing a child who greets well and a child who is praised by others makes me proud from the perspective of parents~^^ As a child with good home education As a result, parents are proud of themselves. Different children have different times to adjust to unfamiliar environments and strangers. Some children need more time. So did my child, because when I met a stranger, I was nervous and frozen. And let me know. \"Let's say hello the next time we meet ^^\" If you don't force it, you'll see a slow but slowly changing child. Don't start expecting a perfect look from the beginning. Children repeat countless times. Fourth, please cherish what your child cherishes with you through practice and time. If your child treats a small toy doll that looks decent and tries to carry it with you anywhere, the mother sees it. Please admit it even if it looks like it is, because it is an object that may seem insignificant on the outside, but it is a precious thing that has an important meaning to a child. By recognizing and responding to your child's emotions like this, he or she can perceive his or her emotions and learn how to react appropriately when they feel them."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Writer: "},{"type":"element","tagName":"i","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":" Author Park Yoon-mi"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tagName":"i","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You can check out the specific practice method that raises the child's self-esteem, "},{"type":"element","tagName":"i","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":" (Hanbit Life, Park Yoonmi)."}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"i","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"i","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"“The child's self-esteem increases with frequent self-encouragement.

Reporter Kim Geun-hyun ⓒBaby News According to him, self-esteem is the power that leads me to live like myself. People with high self-esteem are characterized by excellent interpersonal skills and empathy, high concentration, and self-improvement toward goals. People with low self-esteem are sensitive to the evaluation of others and interpret others' feelings in their own way. It is difficult to accept other people's opinions and try new things. Instructor Oh said, “Self-esteem is an essential condition for a happy life. Self-esteem builds up before the age of 8, when they enter elementary school. After entering elementary school, it is the time when the self-esteem that has been formed so far is adjusted.” “There are “self-esteem thieves” who are close friends and family members. In the family, especially mothers say hurtful words. She said, “Because a highly self-respecting mother makes a child with high self-esteem, she has to look at her mother first before seeing the child.” Preliminary moms gathered at the Happy Times Happy Talk Concert are listening to lecturer Oh Hyun-joo's lecture. . Reporter Kim Geun-hyun ⓒBaby News He pointed out that as a way to increase the self-esteem of parents, pay attention to yourself and find your own hobbies and pleasures. She separately observed the success of my child and me, and emphasized the recognition of the importance and value of the parental role, referring to beliefs, questions, and actions as a way to raise a child with self-esteem. Instructor Oh advised, “A child with high self-esteem is born only when you believe in yourself even when the child is in your belly,” and advised, “Ask the child in the belly and act as the child wants.” Source: Baby News ("},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://www"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"https://www"}]},{"type":"text","value":".

with low self-esteem\nIn general, children with well-developed self-esteem have a stable level of\nself-esteem, whereas children with low self-esteem often change their level of\nself-esteem. Depending on the situation, self-esteem increases or decreases\nrapidly. \n\nIn this case, you have to go through a high level of self-esteem several times\nand help build a stable self-esteem for your child. Of course, just because you\nsee something like the one below doesn't mean your child has a big problem. \n\nIt is an important time when you should observe your child a little more and\nhelp the child feel more positive and confident.\n\nPhoto by H W\n[https://unsplash.com/@h_w?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nHere are most representative characteristics of child with low self-esteem.\n\nThey are afraid of Failure\nIf they feel like they are going to lose, they stop or give up because they are\nafraid of failure. Even if they compete, they think giving up is better than\nlosing. They think, \"I gave up on purpose.\" and give up like that creates the\nthought of‘It is okay because I am not lost.’.\n\nThey don't challenge things likely to fail\nChildren with high self-esteem are not afraid of failure and challenge things\nwhereas children with low self-esteem do not challenge at all because they are\nafraid of failure. It is because the frustration of failure is so loud and\nscary. They hope they have only successful memories in their memory.\n\nThe result is more important than the process\nWhen they work, they think that whatever the process is, only the result needs\nto be good. Because the most important thing for them is successful result\nrather than hard work and experiences.\n\nShortcut is ok If the result is good\nIf the result can be good, they think the shortcut in the process is okay. If\nyou take a child solving a problem book for example, you can see it well.\nChildren with high self-esteem focus on the ability to solve problems,\nregardless of the severity or amount of the problem. If there is a wrong\nproblem, they look closely at it, and they go over the front to see why they are\nwrong. \n\nHowever, children with low self-esteem focus on completing the problem book\nquickly or on the number of circles. they focus on what they can show others.\nTherefore, they increase the number of circles by looking at the answers and\nsolving them or by correcting the wrong answer when grading.\n\nPlay more than necessary to hide the frustration\nThey hate letting others know of a failed situation and cannot stand the\nfrustration. They try to pass over their desire to escape with a joke or\nsomething else. They want to divert their attention by playing around.\n\nThey are seen putting off what they have to do\nWhen they are afraid that they will fail, they tend to put off work and try to\ncreate a situation where they don't have to.\n\nThey push others to hide their inadequacies\nThey re extremely reluctant to reveal their low self-esteem, failing situation,\nor inadequacy. It is because it is scary that others will be frustrated again\nwhen they learn about themselves. That is why they act to push others or\ndeliberately show exaggeration.\n\nThey don't admit reality in adverse circumstances\nWhen a situation is unfavorable to them, they often don't admit the reality and\ntalk about other situations.\n\nMake excuses in advance\nIf the result is not good, they make excuses or say less importance for poor\nresult, such as saying, ‘I didn’t care about this very much, so I purposely\navoided it.’\n\nThe result is returned to other people\nWhen the outcome of work is not good, the responsibility is returned to the\nenvironment or to someone else in order for them to avoid being criticized for\ntheir responsibilities.\n\nOther characteristics\nOther characteristics act to appease others, constantly check for love, or care\nvery much about the gaze of others. A child with high self-esteem and well\ndeveloped self-esteem can make rational and proactive decisions and cope well\nwith negative psychology. However, children with low self-esteem cannot bear to\nexperience failure, so they keep trying to avoid it. But you also have to be\ncareful if your self-esteem is excessive. If you have excessive self-esteem,'I'm\ngood at everything.
