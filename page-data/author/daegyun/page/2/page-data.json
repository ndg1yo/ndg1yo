Making a person who sees my strengths\n\nThe wounds received as a self-esteem vampire are due to relationships with good\npeople\nIt can be healed. But people with low self-esteem\nDetermining whether this person is really for me because of a wound or a lack\nIt can be difficult.\n\nSo you have to be more careful, but nevertheless\nIf you look around well, you will see my strengths that will hold my hand\nThere are many people who have a positive influence.\n\nYesterday, an impressive article appeared.\nIt was an article titled'Because I'm so hard, but will you hug me only once?'\nA girl in her school uniform said to the person sitting next to her,\nMost people hug and comfort students\nThey bought me a drink or something to eat.\nWatch what you do well\nIf you are looking for someone who motivates you to grow and develop in a good\ndirection\nI think it will be a good influence on me and my life.\n\n 1. Praise yourself in the mirror once a day\n\nDo you like to look in the mirror?\nI don't like it, but I don't like it.\n\nMirrors are a great tool to positively consciousize your image.\nOf course, you can also become conscious negatively.\n\nWhat do you see first in the mirror?\nThe person who sees the complex first, the person who sees the most fleshy part\nfirst\nPlease change your gaze and praise your external part.\n\nIt doesn't look shiny, but it's thick, so it's nice.\nIt’s the right size, so it’s very trivial to wear shoes.\nIt can be an important compliment.\n\nOf course, it is also important to recognize the complex as it is.\nIf you have a lot of belly fat, consider it only as a fact that you have'too\nmuch belly fat'.\nAfter that, don't come to a conclusion like'I'm ugly, I'm fat'. Hahaha\n\nBecause the brain creates my image by stacking up what I think\nAt some point, even though I wasn't really ugly and fat\nThe moment will come when you recognize yourself that way.\n\nRemember, the habit of being positively conscious of yourself increases your\nself-esteem.\n\n * Leads to 10 ways to restore self-esteem (bottom). ^^ *\n   https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/39\n   10 ways to restore self-esteem (bottom)\n   10 ways to restore self-esteem, organized by Style Coach (bottom)\n * This is a continuation of the 10 ways to restore self-esteem (top). ^^ *\n   https://brunch.co.kr/@ansyd/38\n * Getting in the habit of accepting praise\n\nIt’s the sixth time now. This takes a lot of effort.\nDid you do it with 7 things? ㅎㅎㅎ;;\n\nI've been taught that it is humility to refuse praise.\nBut even rejection is modest.\nI see that most of the people in our country\nI couldn't take it well and I couldn't even say'praise' well.\n\nA society that is stingy with'praise'\nSometimes I think I'm proud.\nBut it seems that sometimes it takes skill to accept praise.\nIt really depends on what kind of situation, what kind of target, what kind of\ncontext it is.\n\nNevertheless, the praise that comes to me\n'Thank you.' Or, naturally, passing it over as a compliment\nHabits support self-affirmation.\n\nNo matter how much you praise, people who cannot accept themselves\nExpectations of yourself are so great that accepting them\nIt may be unacceptable.\n'I'm still far away.' The thought of'I'm too shy to be praised like this'\nIt could be because you listened too hard.\nBut when the other person sees it, I want to praise him\nRather than refusing that part with my will\nWouldn't it be better to accept lightly with'thank you' for positive\ndevelopment? ^^\n\n 1. Learn confident styling/makeup/hair\n\nThis also has to do with what I do.\nBalance is important in everything.\n\nDecorating your appearance doesn't mean you've been neglected inside.\nIt is important for my self-esteem to take care of the outside with the inside.\n\nFinding the style that suits you, finding makeup,\nHair that will make me confident\nWhen you look in the mirror, it has the effect that you like yourself more.\n\nBy finding the image I was hoping for\nConfidence increases with self-esteem.\n\nHowever, the important thing is that it must be an external self-esteem\naccompanied by inner strength.\nAfter removing colorful makeup, I feel shabby\nAnyone who can’t go outside\nIt is enough to take care of your appearance, but lack the attitude of\nself-recognition.\n\nStyling, makeup, and hair\nThese are the tools you can use to become the better me, the one you want,\nIt shouldn't be a tool to cover me.\nBy acknowledging myself and putting on the appropriate wrapping paper\nDon't forget that I can shine more. ^^\n\n 1. Learn to comfort yourself by patting yourself\n\nFind a friend when you need comfort\nConsultation","html":"<p>Start your favorite activity.<br>Some may say that they don't have an activity they like.<br>But before I say'nothing'<br>If I go back to my past, everyone lives<br>What I did while having fun, the activity that I felt joyful about doing this<br>I think I have one.</p><p>In my case, I can sing, read a book, play the guitar, talk to me, watch a movie, etc.<br>If possible, rather than end with'watching a movie'<br>How to make it mine after watching a movie<br>By keeping a short diary about watching a movie or'review'<br>It's a good idea to create a story.</p><p>It is because such stories gather to create my emotions, my personality, and my story. ^^</p><ol><li>Write down what you like about yourself</li></ol><p>Write 10 things you like about the things that make up you.<br>It can be your appearance, your personality, your ability.<br>It doesn't matter if it's very trivial.<br>'The fingers are long and thin'<br>'I feel good about laughing', etc.</p><p>If you think you don’t have anything you like because of your low self-esteem<br>Ask a friend or family member who cares about you.<br>Then write it down instead of'denying' it.<br>If you look at it every day and try to acknowledge your strengths,<br>At some point you'll start to see things that you like.</p><ol><li>Keep away or ignore self-esteem vampires</li></ol><p>Self-esteem vampires are people who lower my self-esteem and hurt self-esteem.</p><p>Ordinary people easily say things that hurt<br>They say,'It's all telling you to do well.'<br>No matter how much you think of me, my energy<br>If I can’t accept that, so if it acts as a negative energy for me<br>It can never be a good story.</p><p>If even the best gift in the world doesn’t suit the recipient,<br>It's not a great gift, it's just useless.</p><p>In the name of family, in the name of friends<br>The people who hurt me are tied to the'relationship' of family or friends<br>If left unattended, you can make yourself more atrophied.</p><p>I think the story they are telling<br>If it negatively affects me, it's good to take a short distance.<br>It is like minimizing the time to bump into, or having fewer meetings.</p><p>People who thought they were family,<br>To stay away from close friends who thought there was only one<br>It won't be easy.</p><p>But if they really are for me<br>I will try to hear my story, why I want to distance them from them.<br>If not, you don't have to be disappointed.</p><p>When it comes to affecting self-esteem,'relationships' really play a big part.<br>It's because people hurt the most.<br>Here's how to make yourself stronger.</p><ol><li>Making a person who sees my strengths</li></ol><p>The wounds received as a self-esteem vampire are due to relationships with good people<br>It can be healed.
