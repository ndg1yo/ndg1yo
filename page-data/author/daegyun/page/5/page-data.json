Self-esteem and pride are often confused. However, the difference is\nthat self-esteem means affirmation of what it is as it is, whereas pride means\naffirmation in competition.\n\nIf 'pride' arises from interactions with other people, then 'self-esteem' has to\nbe found within yourself.

The more you\nnaturally understand after hearing that, the less self-esteem you may be. Low\nself-esteem means that you value yourself low. That is why you think that you\nare incompetent and useless.\n\nOn the other hand, people with high self-esteem will react in two ways when they\nare told that they are useless.\n\nOne thing is to defend yourself and you list your strengths and strengths, and\nfor this reason, you will think and say that you are never useless.\n\nAnother thing is that when you hear such a statement, you don't react because\nyou already know that you are useless, and you don't even feel the need to\nreact.\n\nIf you feel that more than one of the lists below is true, your self-esteem is\nmost likely to be low.\n\nPhoto by Christian Meier\n[https://unsplash.com/@svenglueckspilz?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nHere are general characteristics of people with low self-esteem.\n\nPeople with low self-esteem\nThey care too much what people think\nThey often think about what other people think if I act like this and \bthey\nignore me.\n\nTheir own way of interpreting\nJust laughing at them feels like they have already been attacked. They think\nabout what others say and give meaning to it.\n\nThey can't believe you compliment \bthem\nThey don't like it and doubt it even when they praise it.\n\nThey can't make eye contact\nWhen they are talking to someone, if they make eye contact for a moment, they\nwilll stutter.\n\nMy fault if others get angry\nIf my friend with me is in a bad mood, I wonder if I'm in a bad mood, so I look\nback on my behavior.\n\nI'm depressed even once pointed out\nWhen criticized, they fall into the end of depression, and even a few of their\nmotivation disappears.\n\nEasily swayed by what others say\nThey believes in everything they hear and they think everything others say is\nmore correct than them.\n\nNo self-assertion\nThey say \"I hate it but I can’t say I don’t like it\"\n\nAfraid of new challenges\nThey think it would be better to do what I always do as the image of failing\nbefore they even challenge is drawn in their mind.\n\nThey belittle themselves\nThey compare themselves to others and blame themselves for not liking them.\n\nPhoto by Christopher Beloch\n[https://unsplash.com/@cbeloch?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nPeople with low self-esteem are more likely to be wielded by the opinions of\nothers. It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves,\nnot inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have\nachieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look\nat'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be\ndisappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional\nfluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing\non the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult\nbecause you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think\nof a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles\neven in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.\n\nAlso, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have\na different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they\nthink that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they\ncannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now\nwill not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure\nrather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this\nwould happen because my value was originally low.\n\nThis low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the\npeople around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for\nyourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a\ntendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the\noutside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from\nothers, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill\nthe poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not\nenough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other\nperson. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt\nthem, who unconditionally fits their needs.\n\nBut there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for\ntheir own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone\nperfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill\nyourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.\n\nPhoto by Jez Timms\n[https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nLet's discuss child with high self-esteem [/child-with-high-self-esteem/] in the\nnext post.‌‌","html":"<blockquote>Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves, not inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have achieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look at'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be disappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional fluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing on the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult because you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.</p><p>Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low.</p><p>This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs.</p><p>But there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for their own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone perfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill yourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Neon love sign\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Jez Timms</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let's discuss <a href=\"https://nadaegyun.herokuapp.com/child-with-high-self-esteem/\">child with high self-esteem</a> in the next post.‌‌</p>","url":"https://nadaegyun.herokuapp.com/people-with-low-self-esteem/","canonical_url":"https://www.nadaegyun.com/people-with-low-self-esteem/","uuid":"f1864586-6965-44a7-9261-38753e929287","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"6024cf8c9a2ad20001f1ff7a","reading_time":4,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<blockquote>Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.

They have the power to be grateful for even the smallest\nthings.\nLet's talk about the characteristics and commonalities of people with high\nself-esteem. Self-esteem affects our lives more than we think and can make us\nmore positive and energetic. as posted earlier, self-esteem is a heart to\nrespect one's dignity, love one's self, and respect one's self. The smaller the\nsize of this mind is, the easier it is to be shaken by the wrods and\ncircumstances of the people around you and hurt yourself without your knowledge. \n\nIf so, let's think about what characteristics of people with high self-esteem\nhave in common.\n\nPhoto by Oziel Gómez\n[https://unsplash.com/@ozgomz?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nPeople with high self-esteem\nDon't depend\nPeople with high self-esteem never depend. As your heart to seek recognition and\nempathy from the other person is increased, your dependence will eventually\nincrease. Efforts to build yourself up is more important than the stability\ngained by depending on the other person.\n\nNot afraid of mistakes\nEveryone makes mistakes. We learn and grow from mistakes, but people with low\nself-esteem are busy blaming themselves for mistakes. When we work thinking that\nno one is perfect, mistakes become a factor that grows us.\n\nDon't be afraid of rejection\nIn life, there are cases when you ask someone to ask for it. People with high\nself-esteem are not hurt even if they are rejected by the other person. If I\nhave the right to make an offer to the other person, the other person has the\nright to decline the offer. Most people don't refuse because they hate you.\n\nAcknowledge your weaknesses\nPeople have many weaknesses. Rather than trying to hide your weaknesses, you\nneed to be confident and accept them. If you admit your weaknesses as they are,\nweaknesses can turn into strengths. People with low self-esteem see only\nweaknesses in themselves.\n\nDon't care about others' eyes\nPeople with high self-esteem do not confine themselves to public appraisal. You\ndon't care how others see you, you just do your job. He refers to other people's\nopinions, but only if he is not influenced, he can live his own life. We have\nthe right to choose our own life and live independently.\n\nPhoto by Wilhelm Gunkel\n[https://unsplash.com/@wilhelmgunkel?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nDon't blame\nIf you have low self-esteem, it's easy to attribute the cause to others. You are\nresponsible for what you decide. People with high self-esteem are never to\nblame. They know how to accept the results, take them humbly, and try to do the\nnext job.\n\nDon't misrepresent the other person\nPeople with low self-esteem are busy trying to misrepresent others if they don't\nmisrepresent themselves. Conversely, a person with high self-esteem appreciates\nand praises the other person's strengths. Looking at the bad points, it is easy\nto see only the endless bad parts. People who love me don't hate others.\n\nNot very angry\nPeople with strong self-esteem do not get angry. I am not easily hurt by what\nothers say, and I rarely get angry after all. When you're angry, focus on\nresolving your feelings and ask,'Is this really something that makes you angry?'\nI worry. A person with weak self-esteem gets angry when he has a strong heart to\nprotect himself.\n\nLike new things\nPeople with high self-esteem make life decisions according to their will. He is\nnot afraid of new things and has the courage to pioneer. He doesn't get all the\nresults he wants by buying a new job. However, a person with high self-esteem\nonly lives with his or her life at risk.\n\nDon't obsess over self-esteem\nThose who succeed objectively do not necessarily have high self-esteem.\nSelf-esteem can be low or high depending on the situation. The self-esteem built\nup by force is unsettling. It is better to recognize and love the way you are,\nrather than trying to increase your self-esteem.\n\nPhoto by Maria Teneva\n[https://unsplash.com/@miteneva?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nLet's talk about people with low self-esteem [/people-with-low-self-esteem/] in\nthe next post.","html":"<blockquote>When you see happy people regardless of the environment, they have their own characteristics.
