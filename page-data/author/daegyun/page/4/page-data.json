with low self-esteem\nIn general, children with well-developed self-esteem have a stable level of\nself-esteem, whereas children with low self-esteem often change their level of\nself-esteem. Depending on the situation, self-esteem increases or decreases\nrapidly. \n\nIn this case, you have to go through a high level of self-esteem several times\nand help build a stable self-esteem for your child. Of course, just because you\nsee something like the one below doesn't mean your child has a big problem. \n\nIt is an important time when you should observe your child a little more and\nhelp the child feel more positive and confident.\n\nPhoto by H W\n[https://unsplash.com/@h_w?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nHere are most representative characteristics of child with low self-esteem.\n\nThey are afraid of Failure\nIf they feel like they are going to lose, they stop or give up because they are\nafraid of failure. Even if they compete, they think giving up is better than\nlosing. They think, \"I gave up on purpose.\" and give up like that creates the\nthought of‘It is okay because I am not lost.’.\n\nThey don't challenge things likely to fail\nChildren with high self-esteem are not afraid of failure and challenge things\nwhereas children with low self-esteem do not challenge at all because they are\nafraid of failure. It is because the frustration of failure is so loud and\nscary. They hope they have only successful memories in their memory.\n\nThe result is more important than the process\nWhen they work, they think that whatever the process is, only the result needs\nto be good. Because the most important thing for them is successful result\nrather than hard work and experiences.\n\nShortcut is ok If the result is good\nIf the result can be good, they think the shortcut in the process is okay. If\nyou take a child solving a problem book for example, you can see it well.\nChildren with high self-esteem focus on the ability to solve problems,\nregardless of the severity or amount of the problem. If there is a wrong\nproblem, they look closely at it, and they go over the front to see why they are\nwrong. \n\nHowever, children with low self-esteem focus on completing the problem book\nquickly or on the number of circles. they focus on what they can show others.\nTherefore, they increase the number of circles by looking at the answers and\nsolving them or by correcting the wrong answer when grading.\n\nPlay more than necessary to hide the frustration\nThey hate letting others know of a failed situation and cannot stand the\nfrustration. They try to pass over their desire to escape with a joke or\nsomething else. They want to divert their attention by playing around.\n\nThey are seen putting off what they have to do\nWhen they are afraid that they will fail, they tend to put off work and try to\ncreate a situation where they don't have to.\n\nThey push others to hide their inadequacies\nThey re extremely reluctant to reveal their low self-esteem, failing situation,\nor inadequacy. It is because it is scary that others will be frustrated again\nwhen they learn about themselves. That is why they act to push others or\ndeliberately show exaggeration.\n\nThey don't admit reality in adverse circumstances\nWhen a situation is unfavorable to them, they often don't admit the reality and\ntalk about other situations.\n\nMake excuses in advance\nIf the result is not good, they make excuses or say less importance for poor\nresult, such as saying, ‘I didn’t care about this very much, so I purposely\navoided it.’\n\nThe result is returned to other people\nWhen the outcome of work is not good, the responsibility is returned to the\nenvironment or to someone else in order for them to avoid being criticized for\ntheir responsibilities.\n\nOther characteristics\nOther characteristics act to appease others, constantly check for love, or care\nvery much about the gaze of others. A child with high self-esteem and well\ndeveloped self-esteem can make rational and proactive decisions and cope well\nwith negative psychology. However, children with low self-esteem cannot bear to\nexperience failure, so they keep trying to avoid it. But you also have to be\ncareful if your self-esteem is excessive.

Even if they compete, they think giving up is better than losing. They think, <em>\"I gave up on purpose.\"</em> and give up like that creates the thought of  <em>‘It is okay because I am not lost.’</em>.</p><h3 id=\"they-don-t-challenge-things-likely-to-fail\">They don't challenge things likely to fail</h3><p>Children with high self-esteem are not afraid of failure and challenge things whereas children with low self-esteem do not challenge at all because they are afraid of failure. It is because the frustration of failure is so loud and scary. They hope they have only successful memories in their memory.</p><h3 id=\"the-result-is-more-important-than-the-process\">The result is more important than the process</h3><p>When they work, they think that whatever the process is, only the result needs to be good. Because the most important thing for them is successful result rather than hard work and experiences.</p><h3 id=\"shortcut-is-ok-if-the-result-is-good\">Shortcut is ok If the result is good</h3><p>If the result can be good, they think the shortcut in the process is okay. If you take a child solving a problem book for example, you can see it well. Children with high self-esteem focus on the ability to solve problems, regardless of the severity or amount of the problem. If there is a wrong problem, they look closely at it, and they go over the front to see why they are wrong. </p><p>However, children with low self-esteem focus on completing the problem book quickly or on the number of circles. they focus on what they can show others. Therefore, they increase the number of circles by looking at the answers and solving them or by correcting the wrong answer when grading.</p><h3 id=\"play-more-than-necessary-to-hide-the-frustration\">Play more than necessary to hide the frustration</h3><p>They hate letting others know of a failed situation and cannot stand the frustration. They try to pass over their desire to escape with a joke or something else. They want to divert their attention by playing around.</p><h3 id=\"they-are-seen-putting-off-what-they-have-to-do\">They are seen putting off what they have to do</h3><p>When they are afraid that they will fail, they tend to put off work and try to create a situation where they don't have to.</p><h3 id=\"they-push-others-to-hide-their-inadequacies\">They push others to hide their inadequacies</h3><p>They re extremely reluctant to reveal their low self-esteem, failing situation, or inadequacy. It is because it is scary that others will be frustrated again when they learn about themselves. That is why they act to push others or deliberately show exaggeration.</p><h3 id=\"they-don-t-admit-reality-in-adverse-circumstances\">They don't admit reality in adverse circumstances</h3><p>When a situation is unfavorable to them, they often don't admit the reality and talk about other situations.</p><h3 id=\"make-excuses-in-advance\">Make excuses in advance</h3><p>If the result is not good, they make excuses or say less importance for poor result, such as saying, <em>‘I didn’t care about this very much, so I purposely avoided it.’</em></p><h3 id=\"the-result-is-returned-to-other-people\">The result is returned to other people</h3><p>When the outcome of work is not good, the responsibility is returned to the environment or to someone else in order for them to avoid being criticized for their responsibilities.</p><h3 id=\"other-characteristics\">Other characteristics</h3><p>Other characteristics act to appease others, constantly check for love, or care very much about the gaze of others. A child with high self-esteem and well developed self-esteem can make rational and proactive decisions and cope well with negative psychology. However, children with low self-esteem cannot bear to experience failure, so they keep trying to avoid it. But you also have to be careful if your self-esteem is excessive.

If your child has\nmore than 6 characteristics below, you can think of him or her as having\nhigh-esteem overall. \n\nNo fear to have relationships with other people\nThey don’t have any fear of having relationships with other people. Children\nwith high self-esteem are not afraid to talk to new people because they are\nconfident that other people will also like themselves.\n\nEmpathy and consideration\nSelf-respect can also lead to others. They already know that the relationship\nthrough empathy and consideration is very stable. It is because they learned the\nattitude or method of maintaining a good relationship through the successful\nrelationships they have been through.\n\nKind and polite\nThey are kind and polite. They learn how to communicate with others by seeing\nwhat other people are doing to them. They learn the kind and polite aspects they\nhave received, and they do it same.\n\nSatisfaction\nThey know how to be satisfied with their achievements. Basically children do not\noverconfident or underestimate their abilities. Children with well-developed\nself-esteem know how to be purely happy with the achievements they have\nachieved. Satisfaction with these achievements become the energy to challenge\nnew things.\n\nNew things\nThey have confidence and try new things well. They know how to be happy and\nsatisfied with his achievements. A feeling of joy makes them not afraid to take\non other challenges. they feel that challenging a new thing itself is not a\nfrightening thing but a joyful thing that gives you another joy.\n\nPassionate\nThey try to do things proactively and proactively. When they do things, they\ndon't act passively and passively. They always try to be proactive and take the\ninitiative.\n\nPositive way of thinking\nThey are not good at negative thoughts. They focus on the current situation.\nWhat if this doesn't work? What if this goes wrong? Instead of being restless,\nthey enjoy and focus on the current situation. Even if they have negative\nthoughts, they think they can quickly come up with a countermeasure or try\nharder.\n\nPositive words\nThey don't use pessimistic words well and words that deny reality or pessimistic\nwords. They express themselves with positive words.\n\nResponsibility\nThey put the responsibility of work on themselves and think that they are\nresponsible for doing something. If they are making a big house out of blocks\nand it doesn't work well, they think that they will just need a little more and\nkeep challenging or they guess they tried to make it too big. Then they will\nthink \"shall we change it a little bit more?\"\n\nNever frustrated\nThey are not very frustrated if they fail something. Even if they fail and\nsuffer frustration, they won't get hurt very much. They just think of ways to\novercome failures. Because they know that with a little more effort, they can\nexperience other successes.\n\nPhoto by MI PHAM\n[https://unsplash.com/@phammi?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nWhat is the result of the level of your child for self-esteem with above\nfeatures?

The more you\nnaturally understand after hearing that, the less self-esteem you may be. Low\nself-esteem means that you value yourself low. That is why you think that you\nare incompetent and useless.\n\nOn the other hand, people with high self-esteem will react in two ways when they\nare told that they are useless.\n\nOne thing is to defend yourself and you list your strengths and strengths, and\nfor this reason, you will think and say that you are never useless.\n\nAnother thing is that when you hear such a statement, you don't react because\nyou already know that you are useless, and you don't even feel the need to\nreact.\n\nIf you feel that more than one of the lists below is true, your self-esteem is\nmost likely to be low.\n\nPhoto by Christian Meier\n[https://unsplash.com/@svenglueckspilz?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nHere are general characteristics of people with low self-esteem.\n\nPeople with low self-esteem\nThey care too much what people think\nThey often think about what other people think if I act like this and \bthey\nignore me.\n\nTheir own way of interpreting\nJust laughing at them feels like they have already been attacked. They think\nabout what others say and give meaning to it.\n\nThey can't believe you compliment \bthem\nThey don't like it and doubt it even when they praise it.\n\nThey can't make eye contact\nWhen they are talking to someone, if they make eye contact for a moment, they\nwilll stutter.\n\nMy fault if others get angry\nIf my friend with me is in a bad mood, I wonder if I'm in a bad mood, so I look\nback on my behavior.\n\nI'm depressed even once pointed out\nWhen criticized, they fall into the end of depression, and even a few of their\nmotivation disappears.\n\nEasily swayed by what others say\nThey believes in everything they hear and they think everything others say is\nmore correct than them.\n\nNo self-assertion\nThey say \"I hate it but I can’t say I don’t like it\"\n\nAfraid of new challenges\nThey think it would be better to do what I always do as the image of failing\nbefore they even challenge is drawn in their mind.\n\nThey belittle themselves\nThey compare themselves to others and blame themselves for not liking them.\n\nPhoto by Christopher Beloch\n[https://unsplash.com/@cbeloch?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nPeople with low self-esteem are more likely to be wielded by the opinions of\nothers. It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves,\nnot inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have\nachieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look\nat'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be\ndisappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional\nfluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing\non the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult\nbecause you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think\nof a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles\neven in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.\n\nAlso, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have\na different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they\nthink that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they\ncannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now\nwill not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure\nrather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this\nwould happen because my value was originally low.\n\nThis low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the\npeople around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for\nyourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a\ntendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the\noutside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from\nothers, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill\nthe poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not\nenough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other\nperson. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt\nthem, who unconditionally fits their needs.\n\nBut there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for\ntheir own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone\nperfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill\nyourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.\n\nPhoto by Jez Timms\n[https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nLet's discuss child with high self-esteem [/child-with-high-self-esteem/] in the\nnext post.‌‌","html":"<blockquote>Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves, not inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have achieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look at'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be disappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional fluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing on the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult because you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.</p><p>Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low.</p><p>This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs.</p><p>But there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for their own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone perfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill yourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Neon love sign\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Jez Timms</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let's discuss <a href=\"https://nadaegyun.herokuapp.com/child-with-high-self-esteem/\">child with high self-esteem</a> in the next post.‌‌</p>","url":"https://nadaegyun.herokuapp.com/people-with-low-self-esteem/","canonical_url":"https://www.nadaegyun.com/people-with-low-self-esteem/","uuid":"f1864586-6965-44a7-9261-38753e929287","codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"6024cf8c9a2ad20001f1ff7a","reading_time":4,"send_email_when_published":false,"email_subject":null,"childHtmlRehype":{"html":"<blockquote>Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves, not inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have achieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look at'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be disappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional fluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing on the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult because you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.</p><p>Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low.</p><p>This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs.</p><p>But there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for their own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone perfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill yourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Neon love sign\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Jez Timms</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let's discuss <a href=\"/child-with-high-self-esteem/\">child with high self-esteem</a> in the next post.‌‌</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.
