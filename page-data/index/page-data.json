Raspberry Pi can be set up without monitor and keyboard as headless setup and\nhow to set up Raspberry Pi without monitor and keyboard will be introduced as 5\nsteps.\nInstall Raspberry Pi OS\nYou can install Raspberry Pi OS on microSD card, USB memory stick or USB\nexternal storage such as SSD/HDD that you need to update firmware.\n\nInstall Raspberry Pi Imager\nInstall Raspberry Pi Imager [https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/]from \nwww.raspberrypi.org [https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/]\n\nInstall Raspberry Pi OS\nRun Raspberry Pi Imager and choose OS. \n\nYou can choose several OS and recommend Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)\n\nClick CHOOSE STORAGE\n\nSelect your storage from the menu\n\nThen click WRITE. \n\nThis takes several minutes as Raspberry Pi Imager downloads and burns selected\nRaspberry Pi OS to selected storage.\n\nWriting\n\nVerifying\n\nCompleted\n\nSet up SSH\nSSH (Secure Socket Shell) is required to enable before you insert the storage\nyou installed Raspberry Pi OS into your Raspberry Pi. \n\nOpen the boot folder of the installed storage\n\nCreate a file named \"ssh\" which is empty and no file extension in the boot\nfolder\n\nIf Raspberry Pi is connected to your network via wired connection, you don't\nneed to set up Wi-Fi and go to SSH connection to Raspberry Pi to enable VNC.\n\nSet up Wi-Fi\nTo set up a Wi-Fi connection on your Raspberry Pi you need to put\nwpa_supplicant.conf with following text in the boot folder you created \"ssh\"\nfile. \n\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\ncountry=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>\n\nnetwork={\n ssid=\"<Name of your wireless LAN>\"\n psk=\"<Password for your wireless LAN>\"\n}\n\nPlease refer to following example\n\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\ncountry=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>\n\nnetwork={\n ssid=\"nadaegyun\"\n psk=\"iloveyou\"\n}\n\nWhen Raspberry Pi first boots, it will copy that file into the correct location\nin the Linux root file system and use those settings to start up Wi-Fi.\n\nAfter Raspberry Pi is connected to power, make sure to wait a few minutes for it\nto boot up and register on the network.\n\nGetting Raspberry Pi IP address\nTo connect to your Raspberry Pi using SSH to enable VNC you need to know the IP\naddress of your Raspberry Pi. This is easy if you have a monitor.\n\nGet the IP address from your router\nYou can check all IP addressses from the main menu of your router, probably\nvisit to http://192.168.1.1 and check IP address. \n\nHere is an example how I got the IP address of my Raspberry Pi.\n\nResolving raspberrypi.local with mDNS\nY [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_%28software%29]\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS]ou can reach your Raspberry Pi by\nusing its hostname.local and ping will show its IP address if it is reachable.\n\nping raspberrypi.local\n\nPING raspberrypi.local (192.168.1.99): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=2.618 ms\n\nnmap command\nTo use nmap to scan the devices on your network, you need to know the subnet you\nare connected to. First find your own IP address, in other words the one of the\ncomputer you're using to find your Pi's IP address:\n\nnmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24\n\nPing scan just pings all the IP addresses to see if they respond. For each\ndevice that responds to the ping, the output shows the hostname and IP address\nlike so:\n\nStarting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2014-03-10 12:46 GMT\nNmap scan report for hpprinter (192.168.1.2)\nHost is up (0.00044s latency).\nNmap scan report for Gordons-MBP (192.168.1.4)\nHost is up (0.0010s latency).\nNmap scan report for ubuntu (192.168.1.5)\nHost is up (0.0010s latency).\nNmap scan report for raspberrypi (192.168.1.8)\nHost is up (0.0030s latency).\nNmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.41 seconds\n\nGetting the IP address of a Pi using your smartphone\nThe Fing app is a free network scanner for smartphones. It is available for \nAndroid\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing] and \niOS [https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fing-network-scanner/id430921107?mt=8].\n\nYour phone and your Raspberry Pi have to be on the same network, so connect your\nphone to the correct wireless network.\n\nWhen you open the Fing app, touch the refresh button in the upper right-hand\ncorner of the screen. After a few seconds you will get a list with all the\ndevices connected to your network. Scroll down to the entry with the\nmanufacturer \"Raspberry Pi\". You will see the IP address in the bottom left-hand\ncorner, and the MAC address in the bottom right-hand corner of the entry.\n\nSSH connection to Raspberry to enable VNC\nNow you can connect to your Raspberry Pi using SSH with the IP address of your\nRaspberry Pi in terminal.\n\nssh pi@your Raspberry Pi IP address\n\nEnter \"raspberry\" as default password\n\nthen your Raspberry Pi is connected by using SSH\n\nOther configuration for headless Raspberry Pi\nAfter SSH is connected to your Raspberry, some more configuration is required in\nraspi-config.\n\n * Configuration tool update\n * Desktop auto login\n * Enable VNC\n * Virtual desktop display\n * Bootloader update for external USB storage\n\nFirst, enter 'sudo raspi-config' in termal.\n\nsudo raspi-config\n\nThen you will see the main menu of Raspberry Pi software configuraiton Tool\n\nConfiguration tool update\nFirst select 8 Update \n\nYou will see update progress as below\n\nDesktop auto login\nselect 1 System Option\n\nS5 Boot / Auto Login\n\nB4 Desktop Autologin Desktop GUI\n\nEnable VNC\nThis will be enable VNC so that you can connect your Raspberry without Monitor\nwith RealVNC viewer [https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/].\n\nSelect 3 Interface Options\n\nSelect P3 VNC\n\nSelect Yes to enable VNC\n\nNow VNC is enable.\n\nVirtual desktop display\nTo set up headless Raspberry Pi you need to use virtual desktop and enable HDMI\nwith some resolution. Otherwise you will see black screen when you connect to\nyour Raspberry Pi with VNC as below.\n\nSelect 6 Advanced Options\n\nSelect A8 HDMI / Composite\n\nSelect V1 Enable 4kp60 HDMI\n\nAfter HDMI is enable then set resolution. Select 2 Display Options\n\nSelect D1 Resolution\n\nSelect DMT Mode 82 as recommendation\n\nBoot loader update for external USB storage\nIf you don't use external USB storage, you don't need to.\n\nSelect 6 Advanced Options\n\nSelect A7 Bootloader Version\n\nSelect E1 Latest version boot ROM software\n\nLatest version boot ROM will be loaded at next reboot.\n\nBoot order also can be chosen in 6 Advanced Options\n\nSelect A6 Boot Order\n\nYou can choose your setting\n\nSelect <Finish> to apply changes\n\nSelect <Yes> to reboot.\n\n\n\nConnect to Raspberry Pi using VNC\nInstall Realvnc viewer [https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/] and\nenter 'your Raspberry IP address'\n\nConnecting to your Raspberry\n\nClick Continue\n\nEnter 'pi' and 'raspberry' as default\n\nFinally headless Raspberry Pi has been completed if you see the following.\n\nNow you can change resolution as you want. Click Raspberry Pi icon on the left\nof top and go preferences and Screen configuration.\n\nClick Configure, Screens, HDMI-1 and Resolution.Choose your favorite resolution\nand apply.\n\nHeadless Raspberry Pi setting is completed.\n\nI will add video clip for better understanding later.","html":"<blockquote>Raspberry Pi can be set up without monitor and keyboard as headless setup and how to
