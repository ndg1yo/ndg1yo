Depending on the situation, self-esteem increases or decreases\nrapidly. \n\nIn this case, you have to go through a high level of self-esteem several times\nand help build a stable self-esteem for your child. Of course, just because you\nsee something like the one below doesn't mean your child has a big problem. \n\nIt is an important time when you should observe your child a little more and\nhelp the child feel more positive and confident.\n\nPhoto by H W\n[https://unsplash.com/@h_w?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nHere are most representative characteristics of child with low self-esteem.\n\nThey are afraid of Failure\nIf they feel like they are going to lose, they stop or give up because they are\nafraid of failure. Even if they compete, they think giving up is better than\nlosing. They think, \"I gave up on purpose.\" and give up like that creates the\nthought of‘It is okay because I am not lost.’.\n\nThey don't challenge things likely to fail\nChildren with high self-esteem are not afraid of failure and challenge things\nwhereas children with low self-esteem do not challenge at all because they are\nafraid of failure. It is because the frustration of failure is so loud and\nscary. They hope they have only successful memories in their memory.\n\nThe result is more important than the process\nWhen they work, they think that whatever the process is, only the result needs\nto be good. Because the most important thing for them is successful result\nrather than hard work and experiences.\n\nShortcut is ok If the result is good\nIf the result can be good, they think the shortcut in the process is okay. If\nyou take a child solving a problem book for example, you can see it well.\nChildren with high self-esteem focus on the ability to solve problems,\nregardless of the severity or amount of the problem. If there is a wrong\nproblem, they look closely at it, and they go over the front to see why they are\nwrong. \n\nHowever, children with low self-esteem focus on completing the problem book\nquickly or on the number of circles. they focus on what they can show others.\nTherefore, they increase the number of circles by looking at the answers and\nsolving them or by correcting the wrong answer when grading.\n\nPlay more than necessary to hide the frustration\nThey hate letting others know of a failed situation and cannot stand the\nfrustration. They try to pass over their desire to escape with a joke or\nsomething else. They want to divert their attention by playing around.\n\nThey are seen putting off what they have to do\nWhen they are afraid that they will fail, they tend to put off work and try to\ncreate a situation where they don't have to.\n\nThey push others to hide their inadequacies\nThey re extremely reluctant to reveal their low self-esteem, failing situation,\nor inadequacy. It is because it is scary that others will be frustrated again\nwhen they learn about themselves. That is why they act to push others or\ndeliberately show exaggeration.\n\nThey don't admit reality in adverse circumstances\nWhen a situation is unfavorable to them, they often don't admit the reality and\ntalk about other situations.\n\nMake excuses in advance\nIf the result is not good, they make excuses or say less importance for poor\nresult, such as saying, ‘I didn’t care about this very much, so I purposely\navoided it.’\n\nThe result is returned to other people\nWhen the outcome of work is not good, the responsibility is returned to the\nenvironment or to someone else in order for them to avoid being criticized for\ntheir responsibilities.\n\nOther characteristics\nOther characteristics act to appease others, constantly check for love, or care\nvery much about the gaze of others. A child with high self-esteem and well\ndeveloped self-esteem can make rational and proactive decisions and cope well\nwith negative psychology. However, children with low self-esteem cannot bear to\nexperience failure, so they keep trying to avoid it. But you also have to be\ncareful if your self-esteem is excessive.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves,\nnot inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have\nachieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look\nat'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be\ndisappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional\nfluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing\non the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult\nbecause you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think\nof a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles\neven in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.\n\nAlso, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have\na different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they\nthink that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they\ncannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now\nwill not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure\nrather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this\nwould happen because my value was originally low.\n\nThis low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the\npeople around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for\nyourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a\ntendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the\noutside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from\nothers, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill\nthe poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not\nenough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other\nperson. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt\nthem, who unconditionally fits their needs.\n\nBut there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for\ntheir own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone\nperfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill\nyourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.\n\nPhoto by Jez Timms\n[https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nLet's discuss child with high self-esteem [/child-with-high-self-esteem/] in the\nnext post.‌‌","html":"<blockquote>Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves, not inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have achieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look at'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be disappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional fluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing on the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult because you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.</p><p>Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low.</p><p>This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs.</p><p>But there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for their own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone perfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill yourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Neon love sign\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Jez Timms</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let's discuss <a href=\"/child-with-high-self-esteem/\">child with high self-esteem</a> in the next post.‌‌</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.

It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"But there is no such person in the world.
