That is why you think that you\nare incompetent and useless.\n\nOn the other hand, people with high self-esteem will react in two ways when they\nare told that they are useless.\n\nOne thing is to defend yourself and you list your strengths and strengths, and\nfor this reason, you will think and say that you are never useless.\n\nAnother thing is that when you hear such a statement, you don't react because\nyou already know that you are useless, and you don't even feel the need to\nreact.\n\nIf you feel that more than one of the lists below is true, your self-esteem is\nmost likely to be low.\n\nPhoto by Christian Meier\n[https://unsplash.com/@svenglueckspilz?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nHere are general characteristics of people with low self-esteem.\n\nPeople with low self-esteem\nThey care too much what people think\nThey often think about what other people think if I act like this and \bthey\nignore me.\n\nTheir own way of interpreting\nJust laughing at them feels like they have already been attacked.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves,\nnot inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have\nachieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look\nat'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be\ndisappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional\nfluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing\non the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult\nbecause you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think\nof a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles\neven in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.\n\nAlso, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have\na different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they\nthink that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they\ncannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now\nwill not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure\nrather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this\nwould happen because my value was originally low.\n\nThis low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the\npeople around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for\nyourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a\ntendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the\noutside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from\nothers, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill\nthe poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not\nenough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other\nperson. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt\nthem, who unconditionally fits their needs.\n\nBut there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for\ntheir own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone\nperfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill\nyourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.\n\nPhoto by Jez Timms\n[https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nLet's discuss child with high self-esteem [/child-with-high-self-esteem/] in the\nnext post.‌‌","html":"<blockquote>Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.

It's because they put the standard of value judgment outside themselves, not inside them. You will lower your abilities and the outcomes you have achieved by meeting the standards of others. There are many people who look at'How will other people see me?' and think,'If you know me deeply, you will be disappointed.'‌‌People with low self-esteem also have severe emotional fluctuations. The reason is clear. You can protect your self-esteem by focusing on the opinions of others who have hurt your feelings, because it is difficult because you do not believe in yourself. It is easy to understand when you think of a boat that is not properly centered. Because it is not centered, it stumbles even in a brief shower and sinks in shallow waves.</p><p>Also, people with low self-esteem think that they are toxic. Others seem to have a different meaning to them even if they just laugh, and for some reason, they think that others will judge me badly. Even if they succeed in any job, they cannot be happy. I feel anxious despite being happy, thinking that happiness now will not last long. Rather, they easily get used to the experience of failure rather than success. Looking at the collapse of myself, I think that I knew this would happen because my value was originally low.</p><p>This low self-esteem is a big problem in life. This is because it affects the people around you, not just your own problems. Lack of respect and love for yourself means that there is something inside that is not filled. Everyone has a tendency to fill in what is lacking. So, people with low self-esteem turn to the outside to fill in the empty inside. You want to get love and attention from others, but it's like pouring water into the poison underneath. I try to fill the poison that keeps draining, so no matter how much I pour it, it's not enough. The more loved you receive, the more you will want from the other person. Furthermore, they want to meet the perfect person who does not hurt them, who unconditionally fits their needs.</p><p>But there is no such person in the world. Because everyone lives by instinct for their own satisfaction as independent beings. No one was born to fit someone perfectly. Because you want other people to have a heart that you can't fill yourself with, you continue to hurt others and hurt yourself.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2000\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Neon love sign\" srcset=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1487059509674-389a7b979022?crop=entropy&#x26;cs=tinysrgb&#x26;fit=max&#x26;fm=jpg&#x26;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE1fHxsb3ZlfGVufDB8fHw&#x26;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&#x26;q=80&#x26;w=2400 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jeztimms?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Jez Timms</a> / <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&#x26;utm_medium=referral&#x26;utm_campaign=api-credit\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Let's discuss <a href=\"/child-with-high-self-esteem/\">child with high self-esteem</a> in the next post.‌‌</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"blockquote","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Self-esteem is the concept of recognizing that you are good and deserving of attention.
