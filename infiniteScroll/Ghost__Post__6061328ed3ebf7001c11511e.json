If your child has\nmore than 6 characteristics below, you can think of him or her as having\nhigh-esteem overall. \n\nNo fear to have relationships with other people\nThey don’t have any fear of having relationships with other people. Children\nwith high self-esteem are not afraid to talk to new people because they are\nconfident that other people will also like themselves.\n\nEmpathy and consideration\nSelf-respect can also lead to others. They already know that the relationship\nthrough empathy and consideration is very stable. It is because they learned the\nattitude or method of maintaining a good relationship through the successful\nrelationships they have been through.\n\nKind and polite\nThey are kind and polite. They learn how to communicate with others by seeing\nwhat other people are doing to them. They learn the kind and polite aspects they\nhave received, and they do it same.\n\nSatisfaction\nThey know how to be satisfied with their achievements. Basically children do not\noverconfident or underestimate their abilities. Children with well-developed\nself-esteem know how to be purely happy with the achievements they have\nachieved. Satisfaction with these achievements become the energy to challenge\nnew things.\n\nNew things\nThey have confidence and try new things well. They know how to be happy and\nsatisfied with his achievements. A feeling of joy makes them not afraid to take\non other challenges. they feel that challenging a new thing itself is not a\nfrightening thing but a joyful thing that gives you another joy.\n\nPassionate\nThey try to do things proactively and proactively. When they do things, they\ndon't act passively and passively. They always try to be proactive and take the\ninitiative.\n\nPositive way of thinking\nThey are not good at negative thoughts. They focus on the current situation.\nWhat if this doesn't work? What if this goes wrong? Instead of being restless,\nthey enjoy and focus on the current situation. Even if they have negative\nthoughts, they think they can quickly come up with a countermeasure or try\nharder.\n\nPositive words\nThey don't use pessimistic words well and words that deny reality or pessimistic\nwords. They express themselves with positive words.\n\nResponsibility\nThey put the responsibility of work on themselves and think that they are\nresponsible for doing something. If they are making a big house out of blocks\nand it doesn't work well, they think that they will just need a little more and\nkeep challenging or they guess they tried to make it too big. Then they will\nthink \"shall we change it a little bit more?\"\n\nNever frustrated\nThey are not very frustrated if they fail something. Even if they fail and\nsuffer frustration, they won't get hurt very much. They just think of ways to\novercome failures. Because they know that with a little more effort, they can\nexperience other successes.\n\nPhoto by MI PHAM\n[https://unsplash.com/@phammi?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit] \n/ Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=api-credit]\nWhat is the result of the level of your child for self-esteem with above\nfeatures?
