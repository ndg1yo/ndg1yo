They express themselves with positive words.\n\nResponsibility\nThey put the responsibility of work on themselves and think that they are\nresponsible for doing something. If they are making a big house out of blocks\nand it doesn't work well, they think that they will just need a little more and\nkeep challenging or they guess they tried to make it too big. Then they will\nthink \"shall we change it a little bit more?\"\n\nNever frustrated\nThey are not very frustrated if they fail something. Even if they fail and\nsuffer frustration, they won't get hurt very much. They just think of ways to\novercome failures.
